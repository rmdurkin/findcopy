VHA Innovation Projects 
iForms (180), Med Rec (152), Checkout (153), IntelliNote (96)
Statement of Work (SOW)

1.0	Background:  The VHA Innovation Program is a cooperative effort between the Health and Medical Information Office (CHIO/HMIO) of VHA’s Office of Health Information (OHI) with VA’s Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) to catalyze and support VA’s next generation of Health Information Technology (HIT).  VHA Innovation Program Goals are to provide tools, resources and processes that:  encourage innovations to emerge from the field; allow innovations to evolve based on collaborative constructive review; provide a safe harbor for innovations to be piloted; and vet innovations from a business and technical perspective.   Four (4) specific innovations are described within this document.  

The four (4) innovation projects in this SOW are all to be based upon an existing Component Object Model (COM) framework for developing and delivering applications to users of the VA’s Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS).  CPRS has the capability of being extended by means of COM modules. These are custom programs that enhance and extend the functionality of CPRS.  The Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) has developed a versatile and robust framework based upon CPRS’s COM technology.  The LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object is a general-purpose CPRS extension that provides us with the ability to enhance CPRS now and in the future without the necessity of deploying additional CPRS COM object Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). to the workstations throughout the medical center.  We can extend the functionality of the COM object by writing server-side logic that processes client requests and returns content back to the COM object to be displayed to the CPRS user. 

2.0 	Scope/Mission:  The Contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, management, hardware, software, administrative support, travel, and technical services required to meet the performance objectives outlined in this SOW.  The scope is to provide for the development within the Innovation Program’s sandbox environment of four different prototypes for specific VHA Innovations programs that are based upon the common framework of the LLVAHCS COM Object.  The four projects will integrate with VistA and CPRS and retrieve and store data in these systems within the Innovation sandbox environment that will be provided to the Contractor.  All data retrieved from VistA/CPRS will be test data.  The prototypes developed by the Contractor will not interact with live or test systems installed at a VA facility.
The objective is to provide software engineering expertise in the development of the requirements and specifications, risk analysis, system architecture, implementation, testing, and ultimately installation of the final working products for each of the four (4) innovation projects described below.  The artifacts produced for each phase of the software development lifecycle must comply with VA architectural and coding standards as well as Section 508 accessibility standards of the Rehabilitation Act.

Contractors shall not transmit, store or otherwise maintain sensitive data or products in systems or media other than VA provided systems within the VA firewall.  

5.0	Travel:  Travel is anticipated for successful completion of this effort.  Anticipated travel includes two (2) trips to VA Loma Linda Healthcare system to attend program/project related meetings, through the period of performance.  The first trip is to take place at the commencement of the requirements elicitation in 6.2.  The second trip will take place at final product delivery as specified in section 6.7.  Estimated duration of onsite trips is to be no longer than two days.  
______________________________________________________________________________

6.0	Specific Tasks & Associated Deliverables: The Contractor shall perform the tasks and provide the specific deliverables described below within the performance period stated in this Statement of Work (SOW).

The four (4) innovation projects to be developed by the Contractor which are to be based upon the aforementioned COM technology are as follows:

1.	VistaForms (aka “iForms”) CPRS has the built-in capability for developing custom electronic forms.  However, this functionality is limited in several respects.  The tool used to create custom forms in CPRS is fairly basic, involving a text editor and a list of fields that can be manually added to create a form.  This precludes many users from creating more advanced forms due to the rather primitive tools available for form creation, and thus places the burden for the development of advanced forms on a relatively small number of users and programmers.   The resulting CPRS forms are also themselves limited in their ability to perform a number of functions.  For example, there are no means for implementing business logic, or even basic control flow logic, in the forms.  Many more complex clinical forms reflect a particular medical algorithm or protocol and require the ability to dynamically modify the form structure or fields depending upon the data being entered by the user or imported from VistA.  Additionally, many advanced forms that require formulas and calculations cannot be implemented using CPRS’s templates.  The Contractor shall develop a prototype framework for rapidly creating and delivering advanced electronic forms for clinical users within the CPRS developmental sandbox environment which would facilitate the continued improvement of electronic clinical documentation in the VA.  The application shall consist of a user-friendly development environment for visually designing the form interface and implementing scripting logic within the form and the server-side presentation and data processing tiers.  The application shall integrate with the aforementioned LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object framework within the Innovation Sandbox environment which provides the hosting platform for the delivery mechanism of the forms to the clinical user within the CPRS environment. The forms development environment is to be developed as a standalone application that allows a non-programmer to create forms by means of a drag-and-drop, rapid application development (RAD) interface.  To create a new form, the user selects a form template from a list of available layouts.  The user then adds text, graphics, or other design elements to the form and selects fields from a controls palette and inserts the fields onto the form.  Available controls include checkbox and radio button, textboxes, drop-down lists, and calendar and date fields.  The user can also insert the deidentified VistA test data objects into the form, including lookup lists and patient information retrieved from VistA. The user can also indicate which form fields are required and specify a range of data-entry values for form verification. A simple scripting language shall be developed which will allow the form designer application to implement basic control flow logic into the form.  The form delivery and processing engine component takes the form created using the development interface and produces a user-interface at run-time for the CPRS user.  The form itself is invoked via a note title in the Notes tab of CPRS and is displayed via a COM object dialog box.  When the form is completed and verified, the note text is generated and placed into the text box in CPRS, and the form data is saved into a VistA file or a SQL database table for further processing or analysis.

2.   Medication Reconciliation - Currently, the Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) uses a Component Object Model (COM object) interface to remind clinicians to perform and document medication reconciliation. Specifically, when a patient is admitted to the hospital, the COM object is initiated at patient selection, requesting completion of medication reconciliation before proceeding further into the patient’s record.  The COM object medication reconciliation tool imports the patient’s medications from VistA and presents them to the clinician on a form.  Checkboxes allow the clinician to select which medications will be continued during hospitalization and which will be discontinued. Additional over-the-counter medications or outside prescriptions can be added through the COM object interface. When the form is completed, a progress note is automatically generated which can be signed through the COM object or edited and signed in CPRS.  In addition, the COM object saves medication reconciliation information to a database to allow for monitoring compliance with the medication reconciliation tool by clinical staff.  The Contractor shall develop an improvement to the COM tool in the Innovation Sandbox environment which allows for a medication ordering function.  The LVAHCS COM object would provide a form with a list of pre-admission medications. Since most VA patients receive their medications from the VA pharmacy, this list will be pre-populated with simulated active, expired, on-hold and pending medications from the VistA pharmacy package. In addition, this list will include in a separate section for non-VA, simulated over-the-counter and herbal medications that will be pre-populated with any medications that have been entered in this VistA/CPRS package. Additional entries for non-VA, over-the-counter, and herbal medications can be entered on the form which will populate that file in VistA/CPRS.  This pre-admission list will be saved in a file in VistA. Once the pre-admission list is populated, the clinician will then review each medication and in a separate column then take action on each medication. The prototype should allow for medications that will be continued during the inpatient stay to be checked or perhaps moved to another column.  When the inpatient list is completed, inpatient orders are ready to be completed. The prototype should integrate to the feature in CPRS which enables the user to transfer outpatient medication orders to inpatient orders, thus allowing the clinician to select a complete button which will generate the inpatient medication orders. These orders will be generated for review and signature and will invoke the usual alerts for medication interactions, redundant drug classes, etc.  Once the orders are completed, the COM object will generate a progress note documenting the pre-admission medication list as well as the inpatient orders generated during medication reconciliation. At discharge, the discharge pharmacist or clinician can invoke the discharge medication reconciliation COM object that will generate the pre-admission medication list as well as the current inpatient medication list. The clinician or pharmacist will take action on each medication and generate a list of discharge medications.  The COM object-based application will create a discharge medication note as well as a patient-friendly list of discharge medications for the patient.  

3.  Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet - The Contractor shall develop an application to provide patients with a patient-friendly summary of their outpatient visit or inpatient stay in an efficient and mostly automated manner.   Using the LLVAHCS COM technology in the Innovation sandbox environment, medication, lab, consult, imaging and text orders in VistA/CPRS would be translated into a readable, patient-friendly instruction sheet.  At the conclusion of an outpatient visit, clinic staff will invoke the COM object through a CPRS note template, a note title, or from the CPRS tools menu.  For example, staff will enter the checkout sheet note title in the progress notes tab of CPRS and the COM object checkout sheet would launch.  Using a medical terminology translation engine, orders placed by the clinician during the visit are translated into patient-friendly language and displayed back to the user in the COM object. Clinic staff print the checkout sheet and give it to the patient to take with them.  A progress note is also created with documentation of the contents of the checkout sheet.   Items included on the checkout instructions include: 1) the provider’s name, clinic name and contact information; 2) future appointments; 3) lab tests; 4) imaging and other tests; 5) consults; 6) all active medications as well as discontinued medications (reconciling changes); 7) medication indications (when only one indication for a medication exists) and; 8) other patient instructions including self-care and patient education.   Patient education and self-care instructions are initiated from a CPRS order menu.  This menu will contain a standard list of instructions for various problems including diet, exercise, wound care, antibiotic instructions, etc.  In addition, the menu will contain lists of patient education sheets from Krames On Demand.  The provider selects a patient education topic and this appears in the checkout sheet as a patient education sheet with an embedded hyperlink to the Krames On Demand intranet site.  Staff doing patient checkout click on the education topic in the COM object checkout sheet and print the Krames On Demand handout. For inpatients, the solution would work much the same way.  First and foremost, the COM object discharge instructions will include discharge medications reconciled using the COM object medication reconciliation described above.  In addition, providers would use discharge menus to select discharge orders for diet, ambulation, wound care and other self-care instructions and education.  Providers will also select patient education material from Krames On Demand from order menus.  Therefore the discharge instructions display discharge medications, self-care instructions, patient education, future appointments, orders for imaging tests and other procedures, consults, lab tests and contact information for the patient’s primary care physician.

4.  IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool - The importance of the treatment for diabetes to the VA health care system is unquestioned but major deficits in care (exist?) are obvious. The VA embarked on an ambitious project to remodel diabetes assessment and intervention through the development of the IntelliNote. The VA has assembled a consortium of clinicians, bioinformaticians, and IT experts to address IntelliNote development. To begin to develop a solution to improving diabetes care, the VA surveyed CPRS records of diabetics with noted care deficits and specifically categorizes these deficits. Any IT developed application will need to address these administrative, patient and clinician focused problems. Based on its initial evaluation the VA is structuring an IT application, IntelliNote, using the LLVAHCS Component Object Model (COM) technology.  The Contractor shall develop within the Innovation program’s sandbox environment a prototype IntelliNote - an innovative and unique solution to diabetes care deficits.  This application will be designed to accomplish the following: 1. The clinician will activate IntelliNote by creating a new note in CPRS with a specific title. The relevant coded and structured data will be automatically displayed to the clinician in a format that will be both tabulated and trended for evaluation. VA diabetes clinics have developed a note format using a simple mnemonic based on 6 areas of care and formats them into an A, B, C headings. For example A being the A1C etc. Using our current “A, B, C” diabetic note structure all of the 6 major diabetes care areas or fields will be assessed and presented to the clinician.  As in every clinical note, the clinician may add unstructured free text.  To minimize “check box fatigue” there will be no requirement for adding free text. The second and most unique aspect is to provide guideline specific recommendation based on decision support rules of logic for each diabetes care field. The recommendations will be generated by the latest clinical guidelines, the VA guidelines and current formulary restrictions and validated by a decision support committee.  The decision support recommendation format will make recommendations based on current gathered information. For example, a diabetic with a low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol not at goal will have a recommendation to start or adjust the VA approved medication after surveying the adverse drug fields and laboratory fields for contraindications.   3. Based on the clinicians’ action, IntelliNote will provide an order set that will allow medication starts and adjustments, laboratory ordering and appointment follow up.  Automatic ordering of exams that will fulfill performance measures will be included. A clinical action committee will decide on the order sets and when established will not require multiple actions by the clinician. For example, a veteran with the elevated LDL cholesterol will automatically be given a laboratory order for two (2) months to reevaluate any medication changes. 4. IntelliNote will generate a patient “report card” in the current “A, B, C” format that can be used by the veteran to track their progress in diabetes care. In addition the report card can provide upcoming orders and appointments within each diabetes care field.   5. IntelliNote will generate a note within CPRS to document the  patient encounter in a structured format allowing for unstructured text entry. The text entry field will be designed to allow innovative text analytic analysis and reformatting text into a structured format for ongoing and future administrative and clinical assessments.

6.5 Task 4.1	Implementation of iForms

The Contractor shall develop a prototype standalone application that will allow end-users to design and create clinical forms.  The form designer application shall be designed such that non-programmers may easily create forms by making use of drag-and-drop controls or widgets placed on a form template.  The form designer shall include data-entry controls that are pre-populated with information retrieved from VistA, for example patient demographic and clinical information.  The form design is persisted and stored on the server for use by the presentation logic, which generates the form interface based upon the output of the form designer tool for display to the CPRS user via the LLVAHCS COM object.  Form data that is entered by the user is processed on the server resulting in a note that is saved in CPRS.  The form data is also persisted to a relational database server (RDBMS) and/or to custom VistA files for processing and analysis by other software. This task shall commence upon completion of the Systems Specifications and Design. The following deliverables shall be in accordance with the schedule in section 7.0.


Deliverables:
a.	Form designer tool for creating form interfaces.
b.	Server-side presentation logic and forms processing logic.
c.	RDBMS schema for storing form data.
d.	Custom M routines and RPCs for retrieving information from VistA.

6.6 Task 4.2	Implementation of Medication Reconciliation

The Contractor shall develop the presentation logic and business logic for an inpatient admission and discharge medication reconciliation tool based upon the LLVAHCS COM Object framework within the Innovation sandbox environment.  The application will retrieve the patient’s existing medications from VistA for display on the user-interface by utilizing sample data in the sandbox environment.  The medications may be sorted by drug class, alphabetically by name, order date, dosage,etc.  The interface will allow the clinician to select which medications are to be continued on an inpatient basis.  The tool will allow the user to adjust dosages and strengths of each of the existing medications.  The tool will allow the user to discontinue selected medications.  The tool will also allow the user to enter non-VA, over-the-counter, and herbal medications that are not otherwise in the VistA system.  When the inpatient list is completed the medications are ordered for inpatient use in VistA.  A progress note is generated and saved in CPRS.  The discharge medication reconciliation interface will also generate a patient-friendly list of discharge medications for use by the patient. This task shall commence upon completion of the Systems Specifications and Design.  The following deliverables shall be in accordance with the schedule in section 7.0.



Deliverables:
a.	Server-side presentation logic and medication reconciliation business logic.

d.	Patient-friendly discharge medication list.

6.7 Task 4.3	Implementation of Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet

The Contractor shall develop a prototype application which provides summary information for a patient in “plain English” reflecting the patient’s outpatient encounter or inpatient hospital stay.  This application will be based upon the LLVAHCS COM Object framework and tested in the Innovation sandbox environment.  The application shall import patient information from VistA, including medication, laboratory, consult, imaging, and text orders that are relevant to the patient’s current encounter using test data sets in the sandbox environment.  Future appointments and other information, such as instructions and educational topics, may also be included on the checkout sheet.  Central to this application is the medical terminology translation engine, which takes medical lingo and “translates” it into text that is easily understood by patients.  The translation engine must be capable of translating single medical/pharmaceutical terms or phrases as well as blocks of text into patient-friendly material. This task shall commence upon completion of the Systems Specifications and Design.  The following deliverables shall be in accordance with the schedule in section 7.0.

a.	Data extraction functionality from VistA.
b.	Medical terminology translation engine.
c.	Server-side presentation logic and data processing logic.
d.	Patient-friendly checkout sheet.
e.	Progress note text generation logic.

6.8 Task 4.4	Implementation of IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool

The Contractor shall develop the presentation logic, business logic, and decision support functionality for a diabetes care tool based upon the LLVAHCS COM Object framework and tested in the Innovation sandbox environment.  The application will retrieve specific laboratory data from VistA as well as coded and structured data persisted from previous patient care encounters involving the current application.  The data will be displayed to the clinician in tabulated and trended formats to facilitate quick assessment by the clinician.  The core of the application will be clinical decision support algorithms that will incorporate the latest clinical guidelines from the VA as well as formulary restrictions.  The application will present the recommendations to the clinician who can then act on these recommendations or make adjustments to them.  The application then automatically orders medications, exams, laboratory tests, and follow-up appointments based on the data collected from the medical record as well as clinician input.  A report card is generated that is suitable for patients to use to track their progress.  This report card includes other relevant information, including orders and appointments.  Finally, a text note is generated that documents the patient encounter and is saved in CPRS. This task shall commence upon completion of the Systems Specifications and Design.  The following deliverables shall be in accordance with the schedule in section 7.0.



Deliverables:
a.	Data extraction functionality from VistA.
b.	Server-side presentation logic and data processing logic.

 SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES
 
 C.1  52.204-7  CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)
 
   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
 
   "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.
 
   "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.
 
   "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4- character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
 
   "Registered in the CCR database" means that--
 
     (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and
 
     (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.
 
   (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the Offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
 
     (2) The Offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the Offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Offeror is registered in the CCR database.
 
   (c) If the Offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
 
     (1) An Offeror may obtain a DUNS number--
 
       (i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
 
       (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The Offeror should indicate that it is an Offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
 
     (2) The Offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:
 
       (i) Company legal business.
 
       (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.
 
       (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.
 
       (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).
 
       (v) Company Telephone Number.
 
       (vi) Date the company was started.
 
       (vii) Number of employees at your location.
 
       (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.
 
       (ix) Line of business (industry).
 
       (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).
 
   (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.
 
   (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.
 
   (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
   (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
   (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

       (iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.

     (1) Data delivered to the Government without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The Government is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.
 
     (2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer in writing for good cause shown) after delivery of the data, permission to have authorized notices placed on the data at the Contractor's expense. The Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Contractor--
 
       (i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;

       (iii) Establishes that the proposed notice is authorized; and

       (i) Permit correction of the notice at the Contractor's expense if the Contractor identifies the data and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or
 
       (ii) Correct any incorrect notices.

     (2) Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer database for delivery to the Government shall be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software.
 
     (3) [Reserved]
 
   (h) Subcontracting. The Contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government under this contract. If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government those rights, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the refusal and shall not proceed with the subcontract award without authorization in writing from the Contracting Officer.
 
   (i) Relationship to patents or other rights. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government.

 C.12  VAAR 852.209-70 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JAN 2008)
 
   (a) It is in the best interest of the Government to avoid situations which might create an organizational conflict of interest or where the Offeror's performance of work under the contract may provide the contractor with an unfair competitive advantage. The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.
 
   (b) The Offeror shall provide a statement with its offer which describes, in a concise manner, all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) or actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the services to be provided under this solicitation. The Offeror shall also provide statements with its offer containing the same information for any consultants and subcontractors identified in its proposal and which will provide services under the solicitation. The Offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its organizational and/or management system or other actions would avoid or mitigate any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest.
 
   (c) Based on this information and any other information solicited or obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR 809.503.
 
   (d) Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the contract at no expense to the Government.

   (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --

     (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the Offeror;

     (7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;

     (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
 
     (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
 
     (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
 
   (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
 
   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
 
   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
 
         (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
 
         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an Offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the Offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the Offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

       (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the Offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

For statistical purposes only, the Offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the Offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
        (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the Offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the Offeror if the Offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the Offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the Offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the Offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.

                            (End of Clause)
 E.4  BASIS FOR AWARD
 
 
Any award will be made based on the best overall (i.e, best value) proposal that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the four evaluation factors: Technical, Past Performance, Price and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business. The Technical Factor is significantly more important than the Past Performance Factor. The Past Performance Factor is significantly more important than the Price Factor.  The Price Factor is significantly more important than the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Factor.  The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. To receive consideration for award a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for the Technical factor.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price Offeror.
 
 E.5  EVALUATION CRITERIA
 
 
The following evaluation criteria shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Technical, Past Performance, Price and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Participation.
 
 E.6  EVALUATION APPROACH
 
 
1. TECHNICAL:  

The evaluation of an Offeror’s technical approach will consider the following:

(1) Understanding of the Problem - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear understanding of all features involved in meeting the requirements presented in the Statement of Work (SOW) and the extent to which uncertainties are identified and resolutions proposed.

(2) Feasibility of Approach – The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposed approach is workable and the end results achievable. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the level of confidence provided the Government with respect to the Offeror’s methods and approach in successfully meeting the requirements in a timely manner. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the Offeror is expected to be able to successfully complete the proposed tasks and technical requirements within the required schedule. The evaluation will also consider the realism of the allocated hours, labor categories and materials.  

(3) Completeness – The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror’s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation.


2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:

The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with the Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance.  The Offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant contracts for evaluating Past Performance.  Relevant past performance information may include key personnel who have relevant experience, predecessor companies, and subcontractors who will perform major or critical elements of this solicitation.  Areas of relevance include contracts that are similar in scope to the SOW.  Recency includes contracts and task orders awarded within three (3) years of the date of the solicitation. Past performance evaluations will be conducted using information obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and any other source deemed appropriate. Offerors without relevant past performance, or for whom past performance information is not available, will receive a neutral rating (FAR 15.306 (a) (2) (iv)).

Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the Offerors, it is incumbent upon the Offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk is with the Offeror.

3.  PRICE:

The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated based on the Total Evaluated Price.  The total evaluated price will be the sum of all line items or CLINS/SLINS.
4.  SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS AND VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION: 

In accordance with VAAR 852.215-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors, the Government will assign evaluation credit for an Offeror (prime contractor) which is a service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) or a veteran-owned small business (VOSB) Offerors which agree to use 7% or more of the contract value to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business or Veteran-Owned Small Business will also receive evaluation credit. In accordance with VAAR 852.219-72, Evaluation Factor for Participation in the VA Mentor-Protégé Program, the Government will assign credit to businesses with approved Mentor-Protégé Agreements.

VHA Innovation Projects 
iForms (180), Med Rec (152), Checkout (153), IntelliNote (96)
Statement of Work (SOW)

1.0	Background:  The VHA Innovation Program is a cooperative effort between the Health and Medical Information Office (CHIO/HMIO) of VHA’s Office of Health Information (OHI) with VA’s Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) to catalyze and support VA’s next generation of Health Information Technology (HIT).  VHA Innovation Program Goals are to provide tools, resources and processes that:  encourage innovations to emerge from the field; allow innovations to evolve based on collaborative constructive review; provide a safe harbor for innovations to be piloted; and vet innovations from a business and technical perspective.   Four (4) specific innovations are described within this document.  

The four (4) innovation projects in this SOW are all to be based upon an existing Component Object Model (COM) framework for developing and delivering applications to users of the VA’s Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS).  CPRS has the capability of being extended by means of COM modules. These are custom programs that enhance and extend the functionality of CPRS.  The Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) has developed a versatile and robust framework based upon CPRS’s COM technology.  The LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object is a general-purpose CPRS extension that provides us with the ability to enhance CPRS now and in the future without the necessity of deploying additional CPRS COM object Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). to the workstations throughout the medical center.  We can extend the functionality of the COM object by writing server-side logic that processes client requests and returns content back to the COM object to be displayed to the CPRS user. 

2.0 	Scope/Mission:  The Contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, management, hardware, software, administrative support, travel, and technical services required to meet the performance objectives outlined in this SOW.  The scope is to provide for the development within the Innovation Program’s sandbox environment of four different prototypes for specific VHA Innovations programs that are based upon the common framework of the LLVAHCS COM Object.  The four projects will integrate with VistA and CPRS and retrieve and store data in these systems within the Innovation sandbox environment that will be provided to the Contractor.  All data retrieved from VistA/CPRS will be test data.  The prototypes developed by the Contractor will not interact with live or test systems installed at a VA facility.
The objective is to provide software engineering expertise in the development of the requirements and specifications, risk analysis, system architecture, implementation, testing, and ultimately installation of the final working products for each of the four (4) innovation projects described below.  The artifacts produced for each phase of the software development lifecycle must comply with VA architectural and coding standards as well as Section 508 accessibility standards of the Rehabilitation Act.

	2.1	Changes to the Statement of Work:  Any changes to this SOW shall be authorized and approved only through written correspondence from the Contracting Officer.  A copy of each change will be kept in a contract folder along with all other products of the contract.  


3.0	Period of Performance:   The period of performance for this effort shall be for one year from date of award.

4.0	Place of Performance:  Place of performance for the work described in this SOW shall be at the contractors location. 

•	Provision of Facilities – The Contractor shall provide all facilities required to support staff assigned to this effort including network connectivity, office space, furniture, personnel support accommodations, etc.  The Contractor shall provide staff with end user computing equipment including common desktop computing software and hardware to perform the required services.

Contractors shall not transmit, store or otherwise maintain sensitive data or products in systems or media other than VA provided systems within the VA firewall.  

5.0	Travel:  Travel is anticipated for successful completion of this effort.  Anticipated travel includes two (2) trips to VA Loma Linda Healthcare system to attend program/project related meetings, through the period of performance.  The first trip is to take place at the commencement of the requirements elicitation in 6.2.  The second trip will take place at final product delivery as specified in section 6.7.  Estimated duration of onsite trips is to be no longer than two days.  
______________________________________________________________________________

6.0	Specific Tasks & Associated Deliverables: The Contractor shall perform the tasks and provide the specific deliverables described below within the performance period stated in this Statement of Work (SOW).

The four (4) innovation projects to be developed by the Contractor which are to be based upon the aforementioned COM technology are as follows:

1.	VistaForms (aka “iForms”) CPRS has the built-in capability for developing custom electronic forms.  However, this functionality is limited in several respects.  The tool used to create custom forms in CPRS is fairly basic, involving a text editor and a list of fields that can be manually added to create a form.  This precludes many users from creating more advanced forms due to the rather primitive tools available for form creation, and thus places the burden for the development of advanced forms on a relatively small number of users and programmers.   The resulting CPRS forms are also themselves limited in their ability to perform a number of functions.  For example, there are no means for implementing business logic, or even basic control flow logic, in the forms.  Many more complex clinical forms reflect a particular medical algorithm or protocol and require the ability to dynamically modify the form structure or fields depending upon the data being entered by the user or imported from VistA.  Additionally, many advanced forms that require formulas and calculations cannot be implemented using CPRS’s templates.  The Contractor shall develop a prototype framework for rapidly creating and delivering advanced electronic forms for clinical users within the CPRS developmental sandbox environment which would facilitate the continued improvement of electronic clinical documentation in the VA.  The application shall consist of a user-friendly development environment for visually designing the form interface and implementing scripting logic within the form and the server-side presentation and data processing tiers.  The application shall integrate with the aforementioned LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object framework within the Innovation Sandbox environment which provides the hosting platform for the delivery mechanism of the forms to the clinical user within the CPRS environment. The forms development environment is to be developed as a standalone application that allows a non-programmer to create forms by means of a drag-and-drop, rapid application development (RAD) interface.  To create a new form, the user selects a form template from a list of available layouts.  The user then adds text, graphics, or other design elements to the form and selects fields from a controls palette and inserts the fields onto the form.  Available controls include checkbox and radio button, textboxes, drop-down lists, and calendar and date fields.  The user can also insert the deidentified VistA test data objects into the form, including lookup lists and patient information retrieved from VistA. The user can also indicate which form fields are required and specify a range of data-entry values for form verification. A simple scripting language shall be developed which will allow the form designer application to implement basic control flow logic into the form.  The form delivery and processing engine component takes the form created using the development interface and produces a user-interface at run-time for the CPRS user.  The form itself is invoked via a note title in the Notes tab of CPRS and is displayed via a COM object dialog box.  When the form is completed and verified, the note text is generated and placed into the text box in CPRS, and the form data is saved into a VistA file or a SQL database table for further processing or analysis.

2.   Medication Reconciliation - Currently, the Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) uses a Component Object Model (COM object) interface to remind clinicians to perform and document medication reconciliation. Specifically, when a patient is admitted to the hospital, the COM object is initiated at patient selection, requesting completion of medication reconciliation before proceeding further into the patient’s record.  The COM object medication reconciliation tool imports the patient’s medications from VistA and presents them to the clinician on a form.  Checkboxes allow the clinician to select which medications will be continued during hospitalization and which will be discontinued. Additional over-the-counter medications or outside prescriptions can be added through the COM object interface. When the form is completed, a progress note is automatically generated which can be signed through the COM object or edited and signed in CPRS.  In addition, the COM object saves medication reconciliation information to a database to allow for monitoring compliance with the medication reconciliation tool by clinical staff.  The Contractor shall develop an improvement to the COM tool in the Innovation Sandbox environment which allows for a medication ordering function.  The LVAHCS COM object would provide a form with a list of pre-admission medications. Since most VA patients receive their medications from the VA pharmacy, this list will be pre-populated with simulated active, expired, on-hold and pending medications from the VistA pharmacy package. In addition, this list will include in a separate section for non-VA, simulated over-the-counter and herbal medications that will be pre-populated with any medications that have been entered in this VistA/CPRS package. Additional entries for non-VA, over-the-counter, and herbal medications can be entered on the form which will populate that file in VistA/CPRS.  This pre-admission list will be saved in a file in VistA. Once the pre-admission list is populated, the clinician will then review each medication and in a separate column then take action on each medication. The prototype should allow for medications that will be continued during the inpatient stay to be checked or perhaps moved to another column.  When the inpatient list is completed, inpatient orders are ready to be completed. The prototype should integrate to the feature in CPRS which enables the user to transfer outpatient medication orders to inpatient orders, thus allowing the clinician to select a complete button which will generate the inpatient medication orders. These orders will be generated for review and signature and will invoke the usual alerts for medication interactions, redundant drug classes, etc.  Once the orders are completed, the COM object will generate a progress note documenting the pre-admission medication list as well as the inpatient orders generated during medication reconciliation. At discharge, the discharge pharmacist or clinician can invoke the discharge medication reconciliation COM object that will generate the pre-admission medication list as well as the current inpatient medication list. The clinician or pharmacist will take action on each medication and generate a list of discharge medications.  The COM object-based application will create a discharge medication note as well as a patient-friendly list of discharge medications for the patient.  

3.  Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet - The Contractor shall develop an application to provide patients with a patient-friendly summary of their outpatient visit or inpatient stay in an efficient and mostly automated manner.   Using the LLVAHCS COM technology in the Innovation sandbox environment, medication, lab, consult, imaging and text orders in VistA/CPRS would be translated into a readable, patient-friendly instruction sheet.  At the conclusion of an outpatient visit, clinic staff will invoke the COM object through a CPRS note template, a note title, or from the CPRS tools menu.  For example, staff will enter the checkout sheet note title in the progress notes tab of CPRS and the COM object checkout sheet would launch.  Using a medical terminology translation engine, orders placed by the clinician during the visit are translated into patient-friendly language and displayed back to the user in the COM object. Clinic staff print the checkout sheet and give it to the patient to take with them.  A progress note is also created with documentation of the contents of the checkout sheet.   Items included on the checkout instructions include: 1) the provider’s name, clinic name and contact information; 2) future appointments; 3) lab tests; 4) imaging and other tests; 5) consults; 6) all active medications as well as discontinued medications (reconciling changes); 7) medication indications (when only one indication for a medication exists) and; 8) other patient instructions including self-care and patient education.   Patient education and self-care instructions are initiated from a CPRS order menu.  This menu will contain a standard list of instructions for various problems including diet, exercise, wound care, antibiotic instructions, etc.  In addition, the menu will contain lists of patient education sheets from Krames On Demand.  The provider selects a patient education topic and this appears in the checkout sheet as a patient education sheet with an embedded hyperlink to the Krames On Demand intranet site.  Staff doing patient checkout click on the education topic in the COM object checkout sheet and print the Krames On Demand handout. For inpatients, the solution would work much the same way.  First and foremost, the COM object discharge instructions will include discharge medications reconciled using the COM object medication reconciliation described above.  In addition, providers would use discharge menus to select discharge orders for diet, ambulation, wound care and other self-care instructions and education.  Providers will also select patient education material from Krames On Demand from order menus.  Therefore the discharge instructions display discharge medications, self-care instructions, patient education, future appointments, orders for imaging tests and other procedures, consults, lab tests and contact information for the patient’s primary care physician.

4.  IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool - The importance of the treatment for diabetes to the VA health care system is unquestioned but major deficits in care (exist?) are obvious. The VA embarked on an ambitious project to remodel diabetes assessment and intervention through the development of the IntelliNote. The VA has assembled a consortium of clinicians, bioinformaticians, and IT experts to address IntelliNote development. To begin to develop a solution to improving diabetes care, the VA surveyed CPRS records of diabetics with noted care deficits and specifically categorizes these deficits. Any IT developed application will need to address these administrative, patient and clinician focused problems. Based on its initial evaluation the VA is structuring an IT application, IntelliNote, using the LLVAHCS Component Object Model (COM) technology.  The Contractor shall develop within the Innovation program’s sandbox environment a prototype IntelliNote - an innovative and unique solution to diabetes care deficits.  This application will be designed to accomplish the following: 1. The clinician will activate IntelliNote by creating a new note in CPRS with a specific title. The relevant coded and structured data will be automatically displayed to the clinician in a format that will be both tabulated and trended for evaluation. VA diabetes clinics have developed a note format using a simple mnemonic based on 6 areas of care and formats them into an A, B, C headings. For example A being the A1C etc. Using our current “A, B, C” diabetic note structure all of the 6 major diabetes care areas or fields will be assessed and presented to the clinician.  As in every clinical note, the clinician may add unstructured free text.  To minimize “check box fatigue” there will be no requirement for adding free text. The second and most unique aspect is to provide guideline specific recommendation based on decision support rules of logic for each diabetes care field. The recommendations will be generated by the latest clinical guidelines, the VA guidelines and current formulary restrictions and validated by a decision support committee.  The decision support recommendation format will make recommendations based on current gathered information. For example, a diabetic with a low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol not at goal will have a recommendation to start or adjust the VA approved medication after surveying the adverse drug fields and laboratory fields for contraindications.   3. Based on the clinicians’ action, IntelliNote will provide an order set that will allow medication starts and adjustments, laboratory ordering and appointment follow up.  Automatic ordering of exams that will fulfill performance measures will be included. A clinical action committee will decide on the order sets and when established will not require multiple actions by the clinician. For example, a veteran with the elevated LDL cholesterol will automatically be given a laboratory order for two (2) months to reevaluate any medication changes. 4. IntelliNote will generate a patient “report card” in the current “A, B, C” format that can be used by the veteran to track their progress in diabetes care. In addition the report card can provide upcoming orders and appointments within each diabetes care field.   5. IntelliNote will generate a note within CPRS to document the  patient encounter in a structured format allowing for unstructured text entry. The text entry field will be designed to allow innovative text analytic analysis and reformatting text into a structured format for ongoing and future administrative and clinical assessments.

6.5 Task 4.1	Implementation of iForms

The Contractor shall develop a prototype standalone application that will allow end-users to design and create clinical forms.  The form designer application shall be designed such that non-programmers may easily create forms by making use of drag-and-drop controls or widgets placed on a form template.  The form designer shall include data-entry controls that are pre-populated with information retrieved from VistA, for example patient demographic and clinical information.  The form design is persisted and stored on the server for use by the presentation logic, which generates the form interface based upon the output of the form designer tool for display to the CPRS user via the LLVAHCS COM object.  Form data that is entered by the user is processed on the server resulting in a note that is saved in CPRS.  The form data is also persisted to a relational database server (RDBMS) and/or to custom VistA files for processing and analysis by other software. This task shall commence upon completion of the Systems Specifications and Design. The following deliverables shall be in accordance with the schedule in section 7.0.


Deliverables:
a.	Form designer tool for creating form interfaces.
b.	Server-side presentation logic and forms processing logic.
c.	RDBMS schema for storing form data.
d.	Custom M routines and RPCs for retrieving information from VistA.

6.6 Task 4.2	Implementation of Medication Reconciliation

The Contractor shall develop the presentation logic and business logic for an inpatient admission and discharge medication reconciliation tool based upon the LLVAHCS COM Object framework within the Innovation sandbox environment.  The application will retrieve the patient’s existing medications from VistA for display on the user-interface by utilizing sample data in the sandbox environment.  The medications may be sorted by drug class, alphabetically by name, order date, dosage,etc.  The interface will allow the clinician to select which medications are to be continued on an inpatient basis.  The tool will allow the user to adjust dosages and strengths of each of the existing medications.  The tool will allow the user to discontinue selected medications.  The tool will also allow the user to enter non-VA, over-the-counter, and herbal medications that are not otherwise in the VistA system.  When the inpatient list is completed the medications are ordered for inpatient use in VistA.  A progress note is generated and saved in CPRS.  The discharge medication reconciliation interface will also generate a patient-friendly list of discharge medications for use by the patient.

6.7 Task 4.3	Implementation of Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet

The Contractor shall develop a prototype application which provides summary information for a patient in “plain English” reflecting the patient’s outpatient encounter or inpatient hospital stay.  This application will be based upon the LLVAHCS COM Object framework and tested in the Innovation sandbox environment.  The application shall import patient information from VistA, including medication, laboratory, consult, imaging, and text orders that are relevant to the patient’s current encounter using test data sets in the sandbox environment.  Future appointments and other information, such as instructions and educational topics, may also be included on the checkout sheet.  Central to this application is the medical terminology translation engine, which takes medical lingo and “translates” it into text that is easily understood by patients.  The translation engine must be capable of translating single medical/pharmaceutical terms or phrases as well as blocks of text into patient-friendly material. This task shall commence upon completion of the Systems Specifications and Design.  The following deliverables shall be in accordance with the schedule in section 7.0.

The Contractor shall develop the presentation logic, business logic, and decision support functionality for a diabetes care tool based upon the LLVAHCS COM Object framework and tested in the Innovation sandbox environment.  The application will retrieve specific laboratory data from VistA as well as coded and structured data persisted from previous patient care encounters involving the current application.  The data will be displayed to the clinician in tabulated and trended formats to facilitate quick assessment by the clinician.  The core of the application will be clinical decision support algorithms that will incorporate the latest clinical guidelines from the VA as well as formulary restrictions.  The application will present the recommendations to the clinician who can then act on these recommendations or make adjustments to them.  The application then automatically orders medications, exams, laboratory tests, and follow-up appointments based on the data collected from the medical record as well as clinician input.  A report card is generated that is suitable for patients to use to track their progress.  This report card includes other relevant information, including orders and appointments.  Finally, a text note is generated that documents the patient encounter and is saved in CPRS. This task shall commence upon completion of the Systems Specifications and Design.

 SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES
 
 C.1  52.204-7  CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)
 
   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
 
   "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.
 
   "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.
 
   "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4- character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
 
   "Registered in the CCR database" means that--
 
     (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and
 
     (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.
 
   (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the Offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
 
     (2) The Offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the Offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Offeror is registered in the CCR database.
 
   (c) If the Offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
 
     (1) An Offeror may obtain a DUNS number--
 
       (i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
 
       (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The Offeror should indicate that it is an Offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
 
     (2) The Offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:
 
       (i) Company legal business.
 
       (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.
 
       (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.
 
       (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).
 
       (v) Company Telephone Number.
 
       (vi) Date the company was started.
 
       (vii) Number of employees at your location.
 
       (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.
 
       (ix) Line of business (industry).
 
       (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).
 
   (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.
 
   (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.
 
   (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
   (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

       (iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in writing.

     (1) Data delivered to the Government without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The Government is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.
 
     (2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer in writing for good cause shown) after delivery of the data, permission to have authorized notices placed on the data at the Contractor's expense. The Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Contractor--

       (iii) Establishes that the proposed notice is authorized; and

       (i) Permit correction of the notice at the Contractor's expense if the Contractor identifies the data and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or
 
       (ii) Correct any incorrect notices.

   (h) Subcontracting. The Contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government under this contract. If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government those rights, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the refusal and shall not proceed with the subcontract award without authorization in writing from the Contracting Officer.
 
   (i) Relationship to patents or other rights. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government.

 C.12  VAAR 852.209-70 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JAN 2008)
 
   (a) It is in the best interest of the Government to avoid situations which might create an organizational conflict of interest or where the Offeror's performance of work under the contract may provide the contractor with an unfair competitive advantage. The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.
 
   (b) The Offeror shall provide a statement with its offer which describes, in a concise manner, all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) or actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the services to be provided under this solicitation. The Offeror shall also provide statements with its offer containing the same information for any consultants and subcontractors identified in its proposal and which will provide services under the solicitation. The Offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its organizational and/or management system or other actions would avoid or mitigate any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest.
 
   (c) Based on this information and any other information solicited or obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR 809.503.
 
   (d) Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the contract at no expense to the Government.

     (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
 
     (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
 
   (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
 
   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
 
   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
 
         (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
 
         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an Offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the Offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the Offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

On the basis of those efforts, the Offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

For statistical purposes only, the Offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the Offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The Offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
        (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the Offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the Offeror if the Offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the Offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the Offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the Offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
 
       [  ] TIN has been applied for.

 E.4  BASIS FOR AWARD
 
 
Any award will be made based on the best overall (i.e, best value) proposal that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the four evaluation factors: Technical, Past Performance, Price and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business. The Technical Factor is significantly more important than the Past Performance Factor. The Past Performance Factor is significantly more important than the Price Factor.  The Price Factor is significantly more important than the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Factor.  The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. To receive consideration for award a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for the Technical factor.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price Offeror.
 
 E.5  EVALUATION CRITERIA
 
 
The following evaluation criteria shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Technical, Past Performance, Price and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Participation.
 
 E.6  EVALUATION APPROACH
 
 
1. TECHNICAL:  

The evaluation of an Offeror’s technical approach will consider the following:

(1) Understanding of the Problem - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear understanding of all features involved in meeting the requirements presented in the Statement of Work (SOW) and the extent to which uncertainties are identified and resolutions proposed.

(2) Feasibility of Approach – The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposed approach is workable and the end results achievable. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the level of confidence provided the Government with respect to the Offeror’s methods and approach in successfully meeting the requirements in a timely manner. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the Offeror is expected to be able to successfully complete the proposed tasks and technical requirements within the required schedule. The evaluation will also consider the realism of the allocated hours, labor categories and materials.  

(3) Completeness – The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror’s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation.


2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:

The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with the Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance.  The Offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant contracts for evaluating Past Performance.  Relevant past performance information may include key personnel who have relevant experience, predecessor companies, and subcontractors who will perform major or critical elements of this solicitation.  Areas of relevance include contracts that are similar in scope to the SOW.  Recency includes contracts and task orders awarded within three (3) years of the date of the solicitation. Past performance evaluations will be conducted using information obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and any other source deemed appropriate. Offerors without relevant past performance, or for whom past performance information is not available, will receive a neutral rating (FAR 15.306 (a) (2) (iv)).

Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the Offerors, it is incumbent upon the Offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided.

Medication Information Standardization White Paper
December 22, 2011



Situation:             	

Medication lists presented to patients from various Veteran Administration (VA) and non-VA sources are different and fragmented, leading to both patient and provider confusion, and an increase in the risk of harm from medication errors. The potential for increased confusion is compounded as we begin to share electronic medical records with the Department of Defense (DoD), TriCare, and other healthcare organizations across the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN). It is critically important for safe, effective, and patient centered care that medication information is accurately and seamlessly shared for reliable medication reconciliation and formation of treatment plans. This has been noted by the most recent Institute of Medicine report on Health Information Technology and Patient Safety.1

Background:	

The VA National Alliance for Patient Medication Information Standardization (VA-NAPMIS) has identified more than 25 different VA projects addressing patient-facing medication lists.  These lists often contain incomplete medication information and ignore critical pieces of information necessary for optimal patient care, coordination, and safety, such as medications prescribed at a different VA facility (remote medications) and non-VA medications.  In addition to the variability in the content of the lists, there is also inconsistency in the types of information that are included and how medications are displayed. The inability to maintain accurate medication information and perform reliable medication reconciliation through transitions of care leads to adverse drug events4-8. (See Screen shots of one patient’s medication information seen through different sources, Attachment “Medication Screen Shots”)
Excerpts from the same medication from multiple sources for one patient across the VA:
Source:
MHV Medication 
History	 
Source:  VA History (VistA Report):
	 
Source:  MHV Prescription History Information:	 



Objectives:

•	Improve patient safety 
•	Decrease patient harm from medication errors and adverse drug events 
•	Maximize usability of meaningful content and display of medication information lists
•	Increase medication information comprehension for all users
•	Identify standards and benchmark with internal and external organizations 
•	Provide effective educational materials and tools for users to manage medication information
•	Make recommendations to improve existing processes and develop new processes 
•	Identify and recommend business requirements and standards to ensure interoperability


Risk Evaluation:

Lack of standardization of medication information poses risks to patients. VA-NAPMIS has identified these issues that represent a few of the problems that result from the lack of standardization across patient facing medication lists:
•	Disrupted quality and continuity of care8
•	Compromised patient centeredness2,8
•	Increased risk of adverse drug events and compromised patient safety9
•	Incomplete and inaccurate medication reconciliation9
•	Patient, family, caregiver and staff confusion and dissatisfaction10
•	Persistence of visual disparity and inconsistent display of VA generated information11


Assessment: 
		
VA-NAPMIS has produced an environmental scan of current knowledge concerning patient medication information lists within the VA. This scan can be seen in the attachment, “Med Environmental Scan” and contains internal and external projects that are active, funded/not funded, in development, or recently closed. 

The following have been noted as the variability seen in these projects: 

Content:  	Each project includes different drug information such as; medication name, instructions, quantity, indication, refills, prescriber, and pill images.
User experience:	Each project is focusing the design differently to meet the needs of the Patient, Caregiver, & Family for their meaningful use.
User Interface:	Drug information displayed does not yet represent a standard VA or Enterprise “look and feel” so that it is easily recognized as the VA or Enterprise Medication List.
Access:  	There are varying levels of access for veterans. For example, some allowed In Person Authenticated access including their surrogate, providers and caregivers, and others did not. 
Enterprise-VA, DoD, and TriCare Approach:	There has yet to be governance and promotion of a unified approach to achieve specific goals in development and business rules that inform an overarching successful process for patient facing medication information. 
Support:	Some projects have Central Office OIT development and support vs. local class III development without central support.
Hardware:  	There has yet to be established a consistent process for national software hosting.
Licensing:  	Some projects required vendor licensing and others generated projects with local development without licensing need, and in a few licensing was undetermined. 
Funding:  	The funding status of these projects was variable with no apparent office overseeing and coordination across all these projects to prevent duplication or conflicting product development. 
Compliance:  	Variable compliance with 508, Privacy, VA Medication Reconciliation Directive, Joint Commission, and Meaningful Use.


Recommendations: 

1.	Establish and communicate the critical need for consistency for all patient facing VA medication information (lists, tools, and applications) available to the Veteran, family, and caregiver and work towards an enterprise approach with DoD and Tri-Care healthcare systems.
2.	Endorse and provide authority for VA- NAPMIS and additional stakeholders from DoD and TriCare, as coordinated by the Director of the VA Patient Medication Information Task Force and Initiative, (formerly the VA Medication Reconciliation Initiative) to: 
a.	Create the standards for elements necessary in consistent Enterprise Medication Information.
b.	Design a unified approach to make certain that this consistency is upheld in current and future medication lists, tools, applications, and/or innovations.
c.	Introduce an interim solution for an Authoritative Source of Medication Information with which all applications will draw upon for medication information.
d.	Address the concern by Government Accountability Office (GAO) that medication information transitions between DoD, TriCare, and VA are accurate, meaningful, and seamless to patients and their healthcare teams
e.	Provide stewardship nationally to the Office of National Coordinator to promote that these recommendations be adopted nationally so that a patient’s medication information may be seamlessly, effectively, and safely shared with appropriate members of the their healthcare team.

 

Conclusion:
Actions to Date:
•	VA-NAPMIS face to face meeting (August 17,18 2011) with 19 attendees  representing 12 programs; NCPS, PBM, MHV,ESM, HMS, OMH My Recovery Plan, CBO Veteran Handbook, CBO VPS Kiosk, Loma Linda Greenfield, Nashville Greenfield, CMOP, and  Portland Informatics 
•	Establishment of the VA National Alliance for Patient Medication Information Standardization (VA-NAPMIS)
•	Bimonthly  telephone conference meetings
•	Presentation of this white paper drafts to multiple stakeholders for feedback
•	Patient Medication Information Tools Environmental Scan completed (see attachment)
•	Initial literature review completed (see references below)
•	Solicitation of key leaders for sponsorship of this white paper and its recommendations
•	Face to face meeting ( December 15, 2011) to explore shared programming on medication information management with PBM,MHV, DoD, TriCare, and Indian Health Services with 22 attendees and 8 programs representing PBM, MHV, OIA, EES,OMH, DoD, TriCare, and Indian Health Services. This white paper was reviewed and plans made to collaborate in the future. 

Future State:
•	A Multi-disciplined Task Force will be endorsed by leadership to carry out the recommendations so that:
o	Patients will be able to enter their medication data through one portal accessed by all available applications the Enterprise, (VA, DoD, and TriCare) employs
o	Patients will receive medication data for their review that has a consistent display and has standard data in the content available to all applications the Enterprise employs
o	This will be represented as one single Enterprise Medication List consumable by patients, caregivers, families, and their Healthcare team(s)
o	This process will be shared with the Office of National Coordinator
o	Compliance with Meaningful Use Stage One will be upheld and Stage Two and Three, as they are implemented

Consequences of Inaction:
Confusion as to what medications a patient may taking will increase with every new and different medication information application our healthcare organization develops and presents to patients, their caregivers, families, and healthcare team(s). This will compromise our ability to deliver safe, effective, and patient centered care not only within the VA but throughout every healthcare organization our patients traverse.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Office of Information & Technology
My HealtheVet Enhancements Now!
R3117074
1.0	BACKGROUND  

The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), is to provide benefits and services to veterans of the United States.  In meeting these goals, OI&T strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the veterans’ health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Grassroots Innovations Program is a cooperative effort between the Chief Technology Officer, the Health and Medical Informatics Office, and the VA’s Office of Information and Technology to catalyze and support VA’s next generation of Health Information Technology Innovation.  The Innovations Program provides VA employees (innovators) with a mechanism to propose new opportunities and to develop these ideas into functional prototypes. 

There are two separate phases to the Innovations Program:  
•	The low bar phase is a proof of concept phase - all work will be accomplished outside of the VA’s network in a virtual testing environment (Innovations Sandbox).  
•	The high bar phase occurs when a concept is moved to a developmental/production environment after the proof of concept has been developed, tested, and approved for full scale development.  
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a requirement for expanding access for veterans. This project is falls within the low bar parameters and will be performed solely within the Innovations Sandbox.

NOTE:  The Government’s preference is that receiving agency’s acceptance is conducted electronically.

On Paper Copy:  The client agency may accept and certify services by providing written acceptance with the signature of the authorized client representative and the date of acceptance.

Electronic and/or written acceptance of the invoice by the CR is considered concurrence and acceptance of services.

Although this acceptance may occur in two ways, electronically or in paper copy, at least shall be obtained prior to the approval of payment.  In order to expedite payment, it is strongly recommended that the Contractor continue to include the receiving agency’s WRITTEN acceptance of all the services or products delivered, with signature of the authorized agency customer representative and the date of acceptance, as part of the submission documentation.

Note: If any invoice is received without the required documentation and, (A) the customer's signed written acceptance OR (B) the customer’s electronic acceptance, the invoice shall be rejected in whole or in part as determined by the Government.  

Posting Invoice Documents: Contractors shall submit invoices to GSA Finance for payment, after acceptance has been processed in GSA’s electronic Web-Based Order Processing System, currently ITSS.

Payment Information
The following procedures, if followed, will ensure timely payment of invoices.

Invoice submission is a two-step process:

Create an Invoice Acceptance Document in IT-Solutions Shop to obtain Client and GSA Acceptance.
Submit the Invoice to GSA Finance either electronically (preferred method), or 
mail to the original invoice to the address stated in the purchase order.



To submit your invoice to ITSS for Client Acceptance, follow these steps.

Log onto the Internet URL http://web1.itss.gsa.gov.
Log into ITSS using your assigned username and password
Once logged in, click on “Create Support Documents”.
Once in the Create Support Documents field, you will see a list of awarded task order numbers and a pull down menu that reads <<Select Support Document>>. Select the appropriate task order number by highlighting it, then click on the pull down menu; select “Acceptance Information” and click on the “Create” icon.
You are now on the page where you will enter the delivery date and invoice number—do not use special characters in the invoice number and be sure to use exactly the same invoice number and value for GSA Finance.  You have the opportunity to send comments to the client (receiving activity) in the detailed comments block.  You must attach an electronic copy of your invoice. Click on the thumbtack “Attach” icon to bring up the attachments page. When you are done attaching the invoice, click on the “Submit” button at the bottom of the page to complete the process.

When the acceptance document is submitted, emails requesting acceptance are automatically sent to both the Client and the GSA Project Manager (PM).  They will accept, partially accept, or reject the invoice, normally with explanatory comments.  The Client will also indicate the amount approved for payment.  The system will automatically notify you, the Vendor, of acceptance or rejection of the invoice.
If you need assistance or have any questions regarding the acceptance and approval process, please contact the ITSS Help Desk at the toll free number 1-877-243-2889. Be sure to have the order number or ACT number available.

AFTER (and only AFTER) you receive acceptance through ITSS, you must then submit your invoice to the GSA Finance Office for payment, using ONE of the following two methods.  DO NOT DO BOTH.

Method 1 – Electronic Submission (This is the preferred method)
If you do not have a password, go to www.finance.gsa.gov and click on “Get a Password for Payment Searches” under “Quick References” on the left side of the screen. Fill out the form and submit. You should receive your password within 24 hours.

Select “submit invoice”.
Select “All POs”.
Find the ACT# or PDN# you are invoicing against and select it. A form will appear that you fill in with your invoice information. Be sure to use the same invoice number (do not use special characters) and value which you used in the ITSS Acceptance document.  If you are resubmitting a rejected invoice, add an “R” or an “A” to the end of the original invoice number or use an entirely new invoice number. The GSA system will not let you use an invoice number you have used before.
Fill in the information requested. All fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required fields.
When complete, click “continue”. If you have made any errors, you will receive an error message. (Worth noting: dates are in mm/dd/yyyy format, money amounts have no $ signs or commas, only a decimal point.) Correct the error and click “continue” again.
You will have an opportunity to upload any backup material as attachments after clicking “submit” on the next screen.
Add any invoice backup material as attachment.

If you have questions please e-mail FW-PaymentSearch.finance@gsa.gov or call the Customer Support Desk at 1-817-978-2408. Anyone there will be able to assist you.

Method 2 – Hard Copy Submission

Return to the ITSS “Acceptance Information” page (per the above instructions) and print the page showing the client’s acceptance.
Mail your original invoice (on official company letterhead), accompanied by the client’s acceptance page, to the GSA Finance Office in Ft Worth, at the address shown in Block 24 (below) of this document. Please ensure that the GSA Delivery Order Number and the ACT Number (found in Blocks 2 and 4 of this GSA Form 300, respectively) are clearly shown on your invoice.

USE THE MOUSE TO CLICK ON “LOGIN”.  Please note that using “cut and paste” may not work.  You may need to type your password which is not case sensitive.

Select “Payment Search”.  This shows paid invoices.
If your invoice is not there, select “View Invoice”, then “all unpaid invoices” (You may also select "search unpaid" and enter specific criteria to narrow the search.)
If your invoice is not there, back up one page and select “all rejected invoices” under “View Invoice”. (You may also select "search rejected" and enter specific criteria to narrow the search.)

Remember that once an invoice shows in the “rejected invoices” section, it will always be there.  They do not disappear when an invoice is resubmitted and paid.  Your invoice could appear in this section multiple times if rejected multiple times.

If there are questions regarding the above, the Contractor shall e-mail or call the Payment Center at: 
FW-PaymentSearch.finance@gsa.gov or Customer Support Desk at 817 978 2408.

ADDENDUM B

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE 
VA HANDBOOK 6500.6, APPENDIX C, MARCH 12, 2010

B1.	GENERAL
Contractors, Contractor personnel, Subcontractors, and Subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

B2.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
1.	A Contractor/Subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, Subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
2.	All Contractors, Subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for Contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
3.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
4.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the Contractor/Subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.  
5.	The Contractor or Subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the Contractor or Subcontractor’s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the Contractor or Subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

B3.	VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
1.	Information made available to the Contractor or Subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the Contractor/Subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the Contractor/Subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
2.	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the Contractors/Subcontractor’s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the Contractor must ensure that VA’s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA’s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of Contractor and Subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
3.	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, Contractor/Subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the Contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a Contractor/Subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the Contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the  Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
4.	The Contractor/Subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 
5.	The Contractor/Subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on Contractor/Subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the Contractor/Subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 
6.	If VA determines that the Contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the Contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
7.	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 
8.	The Contractor/Subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
9.	The Contractor/Subcontractor’s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA’s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
10.	Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the Contractor/Subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA’s prior written approval. The Contractor/Subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the  contracting officer for response.
11.	Notwithstanding the provision above, the Contractor/Subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.

12.	For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the Contractor/Subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the VA COR.

B4.	INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
1.	Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA, NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems. This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference Appendix D of VA Handbook 6500, VA Information Security Program). During the development cycle a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must be completed, provided to the VA COR, and approved by the VA Privacy Service in accordance with Directive 6507, VA Privacy Impact Assessment.
2.	The Contractor/Subcontractor shall certify to the VA COR that applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the VA Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), and the common security configuration guidelines provided by NIST or the VA. This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and VistA (in Protected Mode on VistA) and future versions, as required.
3.	The standard installation, operation, maintenance, updating, and patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the VA approved and FDCC configuration. Information technology staff must also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default “program files” directory and silently install and uninstall.
4.	Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.
5.	The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems, VA Handbook 6500, Information Security Program and VA Handbook 6500.5, Incorporating Security and Privacy in System Development Lifecycle. 
6.	The Contractor/Subcontractor is required to design, develop, or operate a System of Records Notice (SOR) on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and applicable agency regulations. Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties.
7.	The Contractor/Subcontractor agrees to:
a.	Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies:
i.	The Systems of Records (SOR); and
ii.	The design, development, or operation work that the Contractor/Subcontractor is to perform;
b.	Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and
c.	Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a SOR
8.	In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the Contractor/Subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.
a.	“Operation of a System of Records” means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records.
b.	“Record” means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person’s name, or identifying number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph.
c.	“System of Records” means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.
9.	The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as “Systems”), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods. This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hot fixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware. The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.
10.	The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, based upon the severity of the incident.
11.	When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes based upon the requirements identified within their contract.
12.	All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.

B5.	INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
1.	For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, Contractors/Subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The Contractor’s security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the VA COR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA’s network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.
2.	Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
3.	Outsourcing (Contractor facility, Contractor equipment or Contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the Contractor’s systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) Contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
4.	The Contractor/Subcontractor’s system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA’s POA&M management process. The Contractor/Subcontractor must use VA’s POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/Subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with Contractor/Subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
5.	The Contractor/Subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another Contractor/Subcontractor. The Contractor/Subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.
6.	VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or Contractor/Subcontractor owned equipment or software on VA’s network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, PWS or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
7.	All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the Contractor/Subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the Contractor/Subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the Contractors/Subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the Contractor/Subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
8.	Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
a.	Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
b.	VA’s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
c.	VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
d.	Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
i.	The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
ii.	Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
iii.	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

B6.	SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
1.	The term “security incident” means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the Contractor/Subcontractor has access.
2.	To the extent known by the Contractor/Subcontractor, the Contractor/Subcontractor’s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the Contractor/Subcontractor considers relevant.
3.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
4.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the Contractor/Subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its Subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The Contractor/Subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

B7.	LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
1.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. §5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the Contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the Contractor/Subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
2.	The Contractor/Subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a “security incident” as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
3.	Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
a.	Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
b.	Description of the event, including:
i.	date of occurrence;
ii.	data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
c.	Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
d.	Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
e.	Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
f.	Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
g.	The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
h.	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
i.	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
j.	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
k.	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
4.	Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the Contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
a.	Notification;
b.	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
c.	Data breach analysis;
d.	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
e.	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
f.	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

B8.	SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the Contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day’s notice, at the request of the government, the Contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 

B9.	TRAINING
1.	All Contractor employees and Subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
a.	Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

HIM Practice Brief #9
Monitoring Copy and Paste

October 2009

Purpose:  To provide guidance on the appropriate use of the copy and paste functionality and object importing (e.g. medications, problem lists) within the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and to establish clear, standard guidelines for monitoring and reporting its use.  

Background:
The copy and paste function is a useful tool when used judiciously; but misuse is a genuine concern.  When clinically appropriate, it can expedite documentation that may result in improved medical efficiency.  It can be an efficient way to enter complex data that may be relatively consistent over time with only minor modifications required.  However, casually used it may lead to redundant, misleading, inaccurate and non-essential documentation that may jeopardize quality care.

All authorized providers are responsible to apply their clinical judgment to ensure that copied and pasted entries into the health record are relevant, timely and specific to the occasion of service being documented.  To assure integrity, clarity and the validity of electronic patient records; all sites must have an effective copy and paste monitoring and reporting system.  

Guidance:

1.	The electronic functions that allow importing of text from other sources by copy and paste or use of objects are powerful tools; however, this functionality must be used with caution and in accordance with a strict and enforceable policy. Clinical, ethical, financial, and legal problems may result when text is copied in a manner that implies the author or other documenter (such as an RN) obtained historical information, performed an exam, and/or documented a plan of care when the author or other documenter did not personally collect the information at the time the visit is documented.

2.	Copying extraneous information from other documents in VistA, or importing information such as objects is unnecessary duplication of information that does not assist those reading the record.  Repeating information does not enhance patient care or provide any direct benefit, but instead makes reading the charts more difficult and time consuming; copied portions of notes and other data is overwhelming to the reader and minimizes the importance of the remaining information within the note.

3.	Users of copy and paste functionality must ensure that the information being copied or imported is accurate and relevant to the current occasion of service.  Summarizing results or referring to previously recorded data may be more beneficial to the reader.

Risks of Copying Text: Using the copy functionality in an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system poses risk to documentation integrity, including: 
•	Inaccurate or outdated information that may adversely impact patient care and safety 
•	Inability to identify authors or their individual interpretations 
•	Inability to identify when the original documentation was created 
•	Inability to accurately support or defend diagnostic or procedural codes for billing of professional or technical services 
•	Propagation of false information 
•	Internally inconsistent progress notes 
•	Unnecessarily lengthy progress notes 
•	Potential for copy/pasting information into the wrong patient’s record or to the wrong encounter
Rules for Importing and/or Copying Text:

1.	Never copy the signature block into another note.

2.	Never copy data or information that identifies a health care provider as involved in care that the health care provider is not involved in.

3.	Do not copy entire laboratory findings, radiology reports, and other information in the record verbatim into a note when it is not clearly pertinent to the care provided.

4.	Do not re-enter previously recorded data, unless specifically required for the assessment of a specific patient problem.

5.	Use the functionality of importing data objects into progress notes and other documents judiciously.  Facility policy needs to state that any imported object, dialog, etc., if used, must be reviewed and corrected at the source as well as in the document if there is any inaccuracy, and it must be pertinent to the patient assessment.

6.	Do not copy data or information from one patient to another, especially when patients are seen or treated for the same diagnosis.

Accountability:

1.	The authors are liable for the content of copied items within the notes they authenticate.  As part of the health record review function, use of copy and paste functionality must be monitored, and where violations occur, findings must be reported to the appropriate Medical Staff Committee for disciplinary or other adverse action.  NOTE: Criminal charges may be filed when in violation of Federal laws (noted below). 

2.	Failure to comply with these guidance may be deemed a violation of the:
a.	Privacy Act requirement (5 U.S.C. Section 552a(e)(5)); or
b.	Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR Part 2635). 

3.	Disciplinary action may be taken validated non-compliance of this guidance results in the following violations per VA Directive 5021. Violations are:
a.	Charge 05 - Careless or negligent workmanship resulting in waste or delay. 
b.	Charge 11 - Failure to safeguard confidential information.  
c.	Charge 12 - Deliberate failure or unreasonable delay in carrying out instructions.
d.	Charge 25 - Falsifying official agency records.

Monitoring:  

1.	Until such time as a systematic approach for monitoring is available, facilities must establish a local policy (see Appendix A for sample) and, as part of the health record review process, monitor the use of copy and paste functionality (see Appendix B for sample).  

2.	Monitoring shall occur on a monthly basis with reporting of appropriate use of copy/paste on at least a quarterly basis.

3.	Monitoring may be accomplished utilizing the monitoring/reporting tool provided in Appendix C, or by utilizing one of the monitoring tools available on the HIM website at: http://vaww.vhaco.va.gov/him/refsresources.html#copy 

4.	All facility staff performing documentation reviews should be trained to identify instances of copy and paste in the health records. HIM personnel are responsible for the integrity of the health record and have the knowledge necessary to provide this training.

5.	Record Selection for Copy and Paste Monitor:  

Minimum total number of records to be reviewed: 20/month from the various clinical services/patient settings.  An adequate sample of records is reviewed to ensure that all clinical services/patient care settings are reviewed at least annually.

Inpatient: Sample a minimum of 10 inpatient records/month
   
Outpatient: Sample a minimum of 10 health records/month of patients seen during the most recent month 

6.	Result of the monitor must be reported at least quarterly to the appropriate Medical Staff and/or Committee for distribution and appropriate recommendation(s) and/or action(s) as indicated by the results of the reviews.

7.	Focused copy and paste reviews may be accomplished when appropriate or upon request.  A focused review should be in addition to the established monthly copy and paste review.

Copy and Paste Examples:
	A. Non-Compliant Copy/Paste Instances (not all inclusive)

-	Data copied/pasted from another provider’s note without attribution (plagiarism) 
-	Information copied from another VA or a non-VA document without identifying the source (e.g. the facility) of the information, date,  and author 
-	Repetitive copying/pasting of notes day to day (or visit to visit) that do not reflect the current patient status
-	Copying/pasting a list of problems that includes problems that have resolved
-	Duplicating a discrete element (e.g., pain level) at each assessment without noting the current effect of any pain medications
-	Signature block of another note is copied/pasted
-	A list of medications was imported and not reviewed/updated to reflect current medications/dosage

Sample Copy/Paste Policy

Utilization of Copy Functionality for Documentation within the Health Record

PURPOSE: To provide guidance on the proper use of copying and pasting within the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). The purpose of the health record is to provide a basis for planning patient care and for the continuity of such care. Each record should provide documentary evidence of the patient’s medical evaluation, treatment, and change in condition as appropriate. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance on the use of copy/paste functionality when documenting in the electronic health record (EHR). For the purpose of this policy, copy shall be understood to include cut/paste, copy forward, cloning, and any other intent to move documentation from one part of the record to another. 

POLICY: The electronic functions that allow importing of text from other sources by copy and paste or use of objects are powerful tools; however, this functionality must be used with caution and according to strict and enforceable policy.  Clinical, ethical, financial, and legal problems may result when text is copied in a manner that implies the author or someone else obtained historical information, performed an exam, and/or documented a plan of care when the author or someone else did not personally collect the information at the time the visit is documented.  Providers documenting in the EHR must avoid indiscriminately copying and pasting another provider’s progress note, discharge summary, electronic mail communication, and redundant information provided in other parts of the health record. Authors are liable for the content of copied items within the notes they authenticate.

RESPONSIBILITY:  The Chief of Staff, with support and oversight from the Chief, HIM and the facility Compliance Officer, is responsible for overall compliance with this policy.  Clinical Service Chiefs are responsible for compliance in their respective areas.  The Chief, HIM and Compliance Officer will collaborate in conducting periodic reviews of a sample of inpatient and outpatient encounters.  Monitor findings will be reported to the Chief of Staff, Clinical Service Chiefs and (INSERT COMMITTEE NAME, e.g., Compliance or Medical Records Committee). 

PROCEDURE: 

1.	Providers are responsible for the total content of their documentation, whether they originated, copied, pasted, imported, or reused the content. 

2.	If any information is imported or copied and pasted from a prior note, the provider is responsible for its accuracy and medical necessity. 

3.	Providers are responsible for correcting any errors identified within the documentation. (INSERT HOSPITAL CORRECTIONS/ENTERED IN ERROR POLICY) 

4.	Providers must notify (INSERT JOB TITLE e.g., Chief HIM; or DESIGNATED MAIL GROUP) immediately regarding any error(s) in the source note. All notes from the original source that contain errors must be corrected. 

5.     If the provider uses information from a prior note, he/she must reference the note title, author and date of the previous note. 

6.    Never copy the signature block into another note.

7.    Never copy data or information that identifies a health care provider as involved in care that the health care provider is not involved in.

8.    Providers are responsible for clearly identifying who performed each service documented within the note. When entering patient data into the health record that the provider did not personally take or test, the provider must attribute the information to the person who did. 

9.    Do not copy entire laboratory findings, radiology reports, and other information in the record verbatim into a note when it is not specifically addressed or clearly pertinent to the care provided.

10.    Providers are responsible for citing and summarizing applicable lab data, pathology, and radiology reports rather than copy such reports in their entirety into the note. 

11.    Do not re-enter previously recorded data, unless specifically required for the assessment of a specific patient problem.

12.    Use the functionality of importing data objects into progress notes and other documents judiciously.  Facility policy needs to state that any imported object, dialog, etc., if used, must be reviewed and corrected at the source as well as in the document if there is any inaccuracy, and it must be pertinent to the patient assessment.

13.    Providers are required to document in compliance with all federal laws, VHA directives, and Medical Staff Rules and Regulations. 

14.    Once a note has been signed as final, additional information may only be added as an addendum. 

15.    Failure to comply with this procedure subjects the provider to corrective disciplinary action per (INSERT HOSPITAL SANCTION POLICY NUMBER/REFERENCE HERE).

Case Scenarios

The following case scenarios were obtained from the American Health Information Management Association, Copy Functionality Toolkit, ©2008 retrieved from http://www.ahima.org/infocenter/documents/copy_functionality_toolkit.pdf 

These case scenarios represent both potentially appropriate and inappropriate use of the copy and paste functionality and can help facilities understand how copy functionality may work in their settings, and can also serve as a teaching tool. 

Case Scenario 1 
Jane Doe presents to a hospital emergency room for a laceration. While washing dishes this 35-year-old female cut her hand on a knife in the dishwater. She presents to the ED, is triaged, and moved to examination room #1. Following evaluation from the physician, the patient receives 10 sutures with instructions to follow up in 10 days for suture removal. The physician documents his emergency room encounter for this visit, including a complete history and physical and system evaluation. In 10 days the patient returns with no complaints and her sutures are removed. The physician examines the patient and finds no signs of infection and instructs the nurse to remove the stitches. The physician then pulls up his prior ED note, highlights the history and physical and system evaluation sections, and copies that information into the new visit history. The ED coder reviews the documentation and bills for a Level 5 ED visit. 

Result: The first visit was reported consistent with facility E/M guidelines. However, the second encounter was inappropriately reported at the same level as the first visit because the physician pulled forward documentation of services that were not actually performed on the second encounter. The ED coder could not determine that the documentation within the record was from a previous encounter. 

What should have happened? If the physician utilized the copy functionality he/she should have noted the original source document and update the note with the specific information from this encounter. System functionality would allow the user to confirm that he/she copied an entry. The ED coder would recognize the information that was pulled forward, and could then establish the ED level for the second encounter based appropriately on the services performed during that encounter only. 

Case Scenario 2 
A 55-year-old male is admitted through the emergency department of a large academic medical center following a motor vehicle accident. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for a left temporal bone fracture, left femur fracture, grade-2 spleen laceration, and multiple cuts and bruises. In the course of his hospital stay, the patient is followed by the trauma service, neurosurgery service, and orthopedic service, all of which have attending physicians, residents, and physician assistants in addition to medical students. The patient remains in ICU for five days before he is transferred out to the surgery unit to be followed by the trauma service. During his stay in ICU, the trauma medical student initiated daily progress notes for the trauma service, which were expanded upon by the trauma resident and physician assistant within the electronic record. Each progress note was then co-signed by the attending physician. The orthopedic medical student copied forward diagnostic information from the previous day’s documentation, added new documentation and then forwarded it to the orthopedic attending for co-signature. Both wrote new progress notes each day, which were signed by the attending physicians. The neurosurgery medical student used the copy functionality to copy the neurosurgery progress note from the previous day and add his follow up. The neurosurgery resident simply added his information below the medical student’s. The attending co-signed each note without noticing that the student had used copy functionality and selected a level of service based on the entire note. 

Result: The trauma service was writing new notes each day that were then co-signed by the attending service. No documentation issues were identified. The orthopedic service used copy functionality to bring forward diagnostic information only. In addition to this diagnostic information, the medical student and resident wrote different clinical information and updates. The orthopedic attending co-signed each note; therefore no documentation issues were identified. The neurosurgery service, however, used copy to pull forward information from the initial progress note, thus implying that the neurosurgery service was providing the same level of detail in the examination on subsequent visits as on the initial visit. If that is not in fact occurring, the neurosurgery service may be at risk for fraud related to the level of service. 

What should have happened? The neurosurgery service should have indicated which information was pulled forward from previous notes and which information was new information. The attending physician is ultimately responsible for the progress notes within the patient record and should ensure that any resident utilizing copy functionalities has been adequately trained consistent with organizational policies. 

Case Scenario 3 
A 65-year-old woman is a direct admission from her primary care physician (PCP) for pneumonia. She is admitted to the hospital under the care of her PCP to a general medicine floor. The PCP documents an extensive history and physical examination in the EHR and orders the appropriate tests. On day 1 of the hospital stay the physician completes a progress note. On subsequent days 2 and 3 the physician completes progress notes updating the patient’s progress and documents the results of all tests. On day 4 the patient is discharged home. The PCP copies forward the chief complaint and physical examination from the progress note on day 1. The PCP indicates that the information is copied by inserting quotation marks around the documentation and noting “copied from day 1 note.”  He notes on the final progress which phrases have been copied forward and then adds new content underneath. 

Result: The physician appropriately used the copy functionality.

preteristic unpredictions as well as pre-tribulationistic prognostications which plague
the beginning of our new millennium.”
Dr. Francis Nigel Lee, Th.D., Ph.D.
Professor-Emeritus, Queensland Presbyterian Theological College
“End Time Delusions does a fantastic job of expressing what I have believed
for years!”
Pastor Ed Nichols
Newberg Church of the Nazarene
Newberg, Oregon
“While most Baptists today believe in the secret rapture of the saints followed
by the visible return of our Lord, during the Protestant Reformation we held to the
historicist interpretation. End Time Delusions presents a valid academic and theological
challenge to the Left Behind novels.”
H.L. Champion, Evangelist
Administrator, www.Baptist.org
Nashville, Tennessee
“Steve Wohlberg is one of the most dynamic and impressive spokesmen for the
traditional Protestant interpretation of prophecy known as historicism. I wholeheartedly
endorse this latest work.”
Val W. Finnell, M.D.,
Founder, Historicism Research Foundation, Inc.
“End Time Delusions counteracts the ‘wild speculation’ of ‘left behind’ theology
that exists today.”
Herb Frizzell, Sr.
Cedar Hill, Texas
“Steve Wohlberg has done his homework. Although I am not convinced of
every detail he presents, he challenges us all to study the Bible for ourselves and not
to fall for every glib and easy answer that comes down the road.”
Edward William Fudge
Author, Director of Edward Fudge Ministries
“End Time Delusions is a much-needed addition to the library of works on
eschatology. Read it, read it again, and share it with a friend!”
Pastor Bill Wilton
Sunrise Church
McMinnville, Oregon
The Christian Reformed Church in North America
“I’ve studied end time theories for over 20 years and thought I had heard it all,
yet End Time Delusions masterfully ties mysterious Bible passages together in a fresh,
eye-opening way. This book is suited for both the long-time prophecy buff, and people
just now developing an interest in Bible prophecy.”
Don Schaefer
Euless, Texas
“End Time Delusions is a concise, refreshing survey of a vitally important aspect
of Christian teaching. As a Reformed Minister, I warmly recommend it as worthy of
careful study.”
Stefan Slucki, B. Th., D. Min.
Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia,
Seacliff South Australia.
“Steve Wohlberg’s book is a well-written jolt of common sense. There’s a
change coming. End Time Delusions is a part of it.”
Bill Kalivas
Webmaster, www.historicist.com
“Steve Wohlberg’s passion matches that of the great reformers. Whether one
agrees or not it is vital reading to expand the dialog beyond the fictional novel and
movie-hyped, end times scenario that has conditioned the theology of millions of
Christians.”
Steve McNelley, Ph.D.
San Juan Capistrano, California
“End Time Delusions avoids the two ditches of putting the Jewish people on a
divine pedestal or condemning us as Christ-killers and forsaken by God. Steve
Wohlberg’s balanced view will cause us to work together for sharing the good news
with everyone, Jewish or non-Jewish.”

Preface
Growing up just over the hill from Hollywood, California, I had
absolutely no interest in biblical prophecy for the first 20 years of my life,
mainly because I had never heard of such a thing. “Rapture? What’s that?” I
would have said with a mystified look if you had asked me about it. My Jewish
family was warm and friendly, but not spiritual. My brother Michael had his
bar-mitzvah at age 13, but I didn’t, for it was only casually presented as a takeit-
or-leave-it option. As far as I remember, we never read the Scriptures, or
prayed even one time.
As a teenager surrounded by the head-pounding music of Mick Jagger,
The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and the drug culture of the 60’s and 70’s, my
life took a sharp turn in the wrong direction. Some of my friends are dead.
It’s a miracle I’m not where they are.
During the summer of 1979, while inhabiting discothèques nightly, I
worked as an “extra” in the film business. One day I was providentially
assigned to work on a TV mini-series called From Here to Eternity on a sandy
stretch of Oxnard Beach. There I met a fellow extra who “witnessed” to me
about Jesus Christ and the approaching end of the world. With curiosity mingling
with interest—and a nagging sense of need for something beyond glamorous
illusions—I decided the very next day to visit a Christian bookstore
near our home and to scan the prophecy section. Hal Lindsey’s Late Great
Planet Earth was the first Christian book I ever touched. I bought it, and two
of his other books, Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth and Terminal
Generation. Although my marijuana-clouded brain hardly understood what I
read, God used those books and started working inside my mind. A few days
later I found a Bible and began to read. Dimly at first, I slowly started comprehending
the message and grace of Jesus Christ. The turning point came
when I read about the intense pressure Christ endured in the Garden of
Gethsemane, the blood that dripped from His forehead, the appearance of a
heavenly angel to strengthen Him (see Luke 22:39-44), and His unfathomable
love for a perishing world. After wrestling with the cup, Jesus made
that critical decision—the choice to save lost sinners no matter what it cost
Him personally, even if it meant separation from His Father. Finally I read—
using the title of Mel Gibson’s controversial film—about The Passion of the
Christ, and His suffering on the cross for my sins. That did it. Shortly thereafter,
in a dormitory room at California State University of Northridge, I
slipped to my knees and invited my Messiah into my heart. My darkness
turned to light! Jesus freely forgave my sins, removed my guilt, and changed
my life! No more drugs. I was clean.
After discovering that my Messiah came once as the Babe of
Bethlehem, my interest was strongly perked in the subject of His second
coming and the events predicted to occur during Earth’s last days. I
craved understanding, and longed to be ready for the return of the One
who was crucified for me, should it occur in my lifetime. This explains my
enthusiasm and passion for prophecy.
That was over 24 years ago. I’ve learned a lot since I first read Hal
Lindsey’s books while working as an extra in Hollywood. One thing that
has impressed me for years as I have pondered Christ’s first coming, is the
reality that one reason why many religious leaders in Jesus’ day rejected
their own Messiah was because they misunderstood the Old Testament
prophecies predicting His first arrival. Think about it. Because it happened
once, couldn’t it happen again? Could religious leaders today be making a
similar mistake by misunderstanding the prophecies of His second coming?
Yes they could, and yes, many are making such a mistake. That’s why I
wrote End Time Delusions, which not only proves that massive distortions
have entered Christianity, but also clarifies what the Scriptures teach about
the end of the world.
In End Time Delusions, I have combined years of research, countless
hours of study, and only God knows how many earnest prayers for “the
Spirit of truth” to guide me into “all truth” (John 16:13). I hope the discoveries
you are about to make will thrill your heart as they did mine when
I first learned them.
Get ready for an amazing journey, controversial for sure, yet exciting
and rewarding as well. When Jesus Christ does return, may we all “be
found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless” (2 Peter 3:14)
through His perfect righteousness.
Steve Wohlberg
Foreword
British essayist G.K. Chesterton once famously remarked that some
men would rather deny the truth than be behind the times. Steve Wohlberg,
the author of the book you now hold, is not such a man. Wohlberg calls the
reader away from the prophecy malaise of modern times to a truth long forgotten
by most Christians. That truth was mined from the depths of the
Word of God by the great Protestant Reformers of the 16th and 17th centuries,
but for reasons you will soon discover by reading this book, that truth
was bitterly attacked and eventually subverted in the very churches that
claim the lineage of the Reformation.
Perhaps no other area of Christianity has been the subject of more misguided
interpretation and false teaching than that of biblical prophecy, and
the “end times” statements in the Books of Daniel and Revelation. Many
readers of End Time Delusions may be surprised to learn that the prevailing
view in most American evangelical churches, that of dispensationalism, is a
novelty in the long history of the Christian church. In light of that, the obvious
question the reader will want to ask is: “What was the prevailing view,
and how did the current view, as expressed in the Left Behind books and films,
gain such prominence?” Steve Wohlberg answers these and many other questions
in this book.
In some Christian circles another view of end-times prophecy has
been gaining prominence, that of the “preterist” perspective. Although it
takes the opposite approach to the dispensational view, Wohlberg demonstrates
that both views have common roots, and that the genesis of both
was meant to obscure, rather than clarify, what the Word of God really
teaches about the antichrist.
As a pastor and student of Scripture, I appreciate both Steve Wohlberg’s
mastery of the Bible and his commitment to it as the infallible Word of God.

The reader will find this book both a joy to read, rich with illustrations and
examples, and a Christ-centered challenge to prevailing—yet erroneous—
prophetic theories.
Additionally, in much of today’s popular prophecy writing there is a
strong emphasis on sensational events while neglecting to focus the attention
on the risen, reigning Christ. Wohlberg avoids this pitfall and gives glory to
Messiah Jesus, which should be the goal of any worthy book about the end
times. To those accustomed to reading “prophecy books” from other perspectives,
this may seem unusual at first, yet it will become refreshing and will be
seen as biblically based. Finally, let the reader understand: What you are
about to read is no novelty. It is a call to let the Bible speak for itself on the
subject of the past, present, and future of our world.

Introduction
It was 4:09 p.m., eastern standard time, on Thursday, August 14, 2003.
It started with a blip. Lights flickered and then went out, and in a few hours
it was dark from New York to Cleveland to Detroit, even into Canada. The
late-August front cover of Newsweek labeled the event, BLACKOUT OF
2003. Thankfully, the 50 million North Americans affected took it quite
well. Looting was minimal and no one died.
End Time Delusions is about another blackout—a spiritual one—now
occurring within Christianity concerning the true meaning of God’s “sure word
of prophecy” (2 Peter 1:19 KJV). Millions of prophecy-minded Christians,
including me, sense we are nearing the return of Jesus Christ. Yet when it
comes to what the majority thinks is going to happen during Earth’s last days,
and what the Bible actually says will occur, the difference is seismic.
It’s no secret that the following five teachings have become immensely
popular:
1. All true Christians will soon vanish in the rapture.
2. Seven years of apocalyptic terror will overtake those left
behind.
3. One sinister man—the antichrist—will take over the
world.
4. The antichrist will enter a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem,
claiming to be God.
5. The nations of earth will attack Israel at Armageddon.
These five concepts are being taught on radio, television, at prophecy
conferences, in countless books and magazines, in end time movies, in
15
seminaries, and on the Net. This five-point belief system is also tightly
connected—with one event supposedly leading to the next—just like New
York City’s electrical power grid is intertwined. On August 15, 2003 at
4:00 p.m., our nation’s generators, electrical cables, transmission lines, and
systems operators were all working efficiently together. Everything was
fine. Until 4:09. Then a single, high-voltage current forced America into
“the largest power outage in our history.”1
When it comes to popular prophetic theories, is it possible a large portion
of Christianity is now in the midst of another outage—a truth outage?
The Bible clearly predicts, “For the time will come when they will not endure
sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching
ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their
ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables” (2 Timothy 4:3-4).
Has that time come?
The purpose of End Time Delusions is to closely examine the above set
of tightly-meshed theories about the rapture, a future seven-year tribulation,
the antichrist, and the modern Jewish state. As we do, you will discover
irrefutable, high-voltage, New Testament proof of another system failure.
Please read this book prayerfully.
With God’s help, I hope to turn some lights on.

RAPTURE DELUSIONS

Chapter 1
Now You See Them, Now You Don?t
If in the last few years you haven’t discarded a major
opinion or acquired a new one, check your pulse, you may
be dead.
— Frank Gelett Burgess (1866-1951)
Although the exact word, “rapture,” isn’t in the Bible, millions of
prophecy-minded Christians have nevertheless been taught that soon
God’s Church will disappear from Planet Earth without a trace. Headlines
are predicted to read: “Multitudes Missing, Chaos Sweeps Globe!” “All
Children Have Disappeared!” “Massive Traffic Snarls Due to Evaporated
Drivers!” “Planes Crash, Trains Wreck, as Pilots and Engineers Vanish!”
Perhaps you’ve seen bumper stickers reading: “In case of Rapture, this
vehicle will be unmanned.”
In the last few years, the number-one promoter of the rapture idea has
been the New York Times bestselling Left Behind series, coauthored by Tim
LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. A high-speed, 12-book sequence of novels
about the end times, Left Behind teaches that the return of Jesus Christ takes
place in two distinct phases. First, Jesus comes invisibly to remove His Church
before a seven-year tribulation during which the rest of humanity must face
the antichrist. This is the rapture. At the end of those seven years, Jesus will
again return visibly to deliver those who became Christians during the tribulation—
after being given a “second chance” to be saved—and to pulverize
the invading enemies of Israel at Armageddon. This is the second coming.
Thus it’s rapture first, then seven years with the antichrist, then the visible
second coming of Jesus Christ.
21
These popular concepts—rapture, seven years of horror, future
antichrist—have also been taught in many apocalyptic Christian films, such
as A Thief in the Night, Image of the Beast, Tribulation Force, The Omega Code,
Left Behind: The Movie, and Megiddo. Because the rapture teaching has been
promoted so heavily in our society, even among those outside the Church, a
rumor has circulated that some higher-ups at American Airlines want at least
one non-Christian pilot aboard each flight—just in case!
The real question is: Although “rapture” isn’t a biblical word, is the
doctrine there? If not, could it be an end time delusion? Let’s find out.
First of all, the Bible certainly does teach the exciting truth that Jesus
Christ will return for His people. Our Lord Himself said, “I will come again
and receive you to Myself” (John 14:3). All Christians should believe Christ’s
promise and long to meet Him on that great day.
But will He come invisibly? Will the Church disappear? Does the
Bible really teach vanishing Christians? Without a doubt, the most quoted
passage used to support the rapture concept is 1 Thessalonians 4:17. Lots of
Christians know this verse by heart, and it is cited in Left Behind: The
Movie. There Paul wrote that true believers will someday be “caught up…
in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air” (1 Thessalonians 4:17). But does
“caught up” mean disappear? Is Paul describing a silent return of Jesus
Christ before an apocalyptic seven-year tribulation? We don’t need to
guess. The answer is in the context, and you don’t need to have a four-year
degree to grasp the truth.
Have you ever driven down a highway without realizing how fast you
were going, and then, when you finally looked down at your speedometer,
you thought to yourself, I’m going too fast and must slow down!? This is
what we need to do with 1 Thessalonians 4. We must slow down and take
a full look.
Here is what Paul actually wrote:
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God.
And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive
and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds
to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with
the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).
Rapture teachers interpret this event as silent and secret, yet doesn’t it
seem rather loud and visible? There is a shout, a voice, a trumpet. Have you
ever heard of a silent trumpet? The truth is, 1 Thessalonians 4:16 is one of
the noisiest verses in the Bible! Look carefully: Jesus Christ comes down from
Heaven shouting and blowing a trumpet. The dead rise. Then true believers
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
22
are “caught up.” Honestly, do you see anything here about vanishing
Christians prior to the tribulation? Rapture promoters interpret “caught up”
to mean disappear because this view fits their tightly-meshed prophetic system,
yet it must be admitted that the text doesn’t say this.
Two thousand years ago, at the end of His earthly life, Jesus Christ was
also “taken up,” (Acts 1:9). This doesn’t mean He disappeared, leaving His
clothes on earth. Instead, in full view of His wondering disciples, “while they
watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight” (Acts
1:9, emphasis added). This event was highly visible. Luke said Jesus Christ
was “taken up,” and then clouds are mentioned, just like Paul wrote about
believers being “caught up…in the clouds.”
Notice carefully the full context of Acts 1:9:
Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He
was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And
while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up,
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, who also said,
“Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven?
This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will
so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into
heaven” (Acts 1:9-11, emphasis added).
Here we have holy angels—in the form of men in white robes—explaining
the simple truth about Jesus Christ’s return. They told the disciples that
just as Jesus was literally and visibly “taken up” into the clouds, even so would
He “come in like manner as [they had seen] Him go into heaven.” Although
these angels never attended a seminary, there’s no doubt they had their theology
straight. They taught no secret coming or vanishing Christians.
Everything will be highly visible, just like the ascension of Jesus Christ.
Let’s return to 1 Thessalonians and take a look at the thief-in-the-night idea:
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with
the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the
dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the
Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.
Therefore comfort one another with these words. But concerning
the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I
should write to you. For you yourselves know perfectly that the
day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. For when they
say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon
them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not
escape (1 Thessalonians 4:16–5:3, emphasis added).
Now You See Them, Now You Don’t
23
Here Paul compares the coming of Jesus Christ to the arrival of a midnight
thief. Rapture promoters interpret this to mean Jesus will come like a
silent thief to snatch believers off this earth before seven years of chaos—then
driverless cars will crash, pilotless planes will collide, and babies will be found
missing from their cribs. The Christian film, A Thief in the Night, which is
similar to Left Behind: The Movie, portrays this dramatically. Yet is this really
what Paul is saying?
Again, let’s slow down and take a closer look at our biblical speedometers.
First of all, the day when Jesus comes as a thief is clearly the very same
day in which He descends with a shout and a trumpet blast. Secondly, it
comes as “a thief in the night” only upon the unprepared. When it hits, “sudden
destruction comes upon them [the lost], as labor pains upon a pregnant
woman. And they shall not escape.”
Do you see what Paul is really saying? Jesus’ coming as a “thief in the
night” does not mean He will come quietly and invisibly to steal believers out
of this world, as is taught in rapture movies and New York Times bestselling
books. Rather, it means He will come unexpectedly, bringing “sudden
destruction” upon the unsaved. Thus it is not a secret coming, but only a sudden
one. Will the unprepared get a “second chance” to be saved during a subsequent
seven-year tribulation? Paul answered this question when he wrote,
“They shall not escape” (verse 3).
Here’s a simple summary of what 1 Thessalonians 4:16-5:3 really says:
• Jesus Christ will literally descend from Heaven with a shout
and a trumpet blast.
• The dead in Christ will rise first and true believers will be
“caught up,” just like Jesus Christ Himself was visibly
“taken up” into the sky almost 2,000 years ago.
• This cataclysmic “day of the Lord” will burst upon the
unprepared like the unexpected arrival of a midnight thief.
• “Sudden destruction” will overwhelm the lost, “and they
shall not escape.”
When taken literally, these words describe the visible second coming of
Jesus Christ, not a secret rapture.
Immediately after his solemn prediction of Christ’s return as a midnight
thief, Paul wrote to true believers: “But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so
that this Day should overtake you as a thief. You are all sons of light and sons
of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:4-5).

Remember the Blackout of 2003? It left 50 million North Americans in
darkness because a massive system failure short-circuited our electrical power
grid. At least when it comes to 1 Thessalonians 4:16-5:3, we have just witnessed
another system failure. The popular doctrine of a silent, secret return
of Jesus Christ and vanishing Christians is just not there.
Again, Paul wrote, “You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are
not of the night nor of darkness” (1 Thessalonians 5:5).
God wants us to avoid truth outages.
He wants the lights on.

Chapter 2
The Parousia and Twinkling Eyes
Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the
shadow.
—Aesop (620-560 B.C.)
Jesus Christ predicted, “Then two men will be in the field: one will be
taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be
taken and the other left. Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour
your Lord is coming” (Matthew 24:40-42).
This is probably the second most quoted Scripture in the Bible used to
support the doctrine of an invisible return of Jesus Christ and vanishing
Christians. Supposedly, “one will be taken and the other left” means believers
will disappear in an unperceived flash, while the rest of the world suddenly
wakes up in mystified ignorance wondering, Which way did they go?
Again, the key is in the context. Matthew 24 begins with our Savior
quietly sitting upon the Mount of Olives. His “disciples came to Him privately,
saying, ‘Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the
sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?’ ” (Matthew 24:3)
Obviously, the disciples were thinking about Jesus’ return and the end of
the world. Because of mental gaps and some loose ends, they asked the
Master to clarify the truth.
Before we look at Christ’s response, notice the little word, “coming,” in
verse 3. The original Greek word there is, “Parousia”—you can check it in any
good concordance. While you don’t need to be a Greek scholar to understand
the Bible, that small word is of large importance. As we shall soon see, the
“Parousia Principle” will soon provide vital insights into the rapture question.
27
In response to His disciples’ please-clarify-the-end inquiry, Christ’s very
first words were, “Take heed that no one deceives you” (Matthew 24:4). The
forcefulness of this response should hit us like a hurricane! Why? Because it
clearly implies that when it comes to this exact topic of His “coming” or
“Parousia,” Jesus knew there was going to be a great deal of deception whirling
around. And what is even more dramatic is that Christ raised His “Don’t Be
Deceived” warning flag four times in this single sermon (see Matthew 24: 4-
5,11,24). One gets the idea that end time delusions will someday sweep over
Planet Earth like a massive tidal wave. The only way to avoid being swept
away in this swirling sea of falsehood is to pay close attention to the exact
words of Jesus Christ.
Our Lord continued, “For false christs and false prophets will rise and
show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect”
(Matthew 24:24). Here Jesus said satan’s delusions will eventually become so
subtle and powerful that only “the elect” will come through unscathed. Who
are “the elect”? Based on the context, they must be a group of people who
know the Truth Teller and the Bible so well that even the devil can’t mislead
them. Verse 31 also tells us that “the elect” are people who are ready for the
return of Jesus Christ.
Immediately after warning about tricky false prophets and deception,
Jesus said, “Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert;
go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the
lightning cometh out of the east, and shines even unto the west; so shall also
the coming of the Son of man be” (Matthew 24:26-27 KJV, emphasis added).
Here Jesus draws a razor-sharp contrast between false views of His return and
the truth.
Concerning false views, don’t miss that little word, “secret” (verse 26).
Jesus plainly warned that some will mistakenly promote a “secret” coming.
Based on the context, we discover that this will be one of those powerful
delusions which only God’s faithful elect will avoid. How should we respond
to the idea of a secret return? Christ’s answer is stunning. “Believe it not”!
Why? Because “as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west,
so also will the coming of the Son of Man be” (verse 27).
Far from being a secret event, Jesus Himself compares His return to the
brilliant flashing of electrically-charged bolts of lightning hurtling across the
sky. Now here’s an important point. Guess what exact Greek word Matthew
used for “coming” in verse 27? The same one he used in verse 3—“Parousia.”
This is clear evidence that the Parousia definitely applies to the highly visible
second coming of Jesus Christ. In Hollywood action movies, hidden files
are sometimes labeled, “Top Secret.” When it comes to the Parousia, Jesus
clarified it would be anything but secret.
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
28
Christ’s bewildered disciples had inquired, “…what will be the sign of Your
coming [the Parousia], and of the end of the age?” After warning about secretive
delusions, Jesus finally answered their exact question by lifting the curtain of history
and fully unveiling what His cataclysmic return would be like:
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and
then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the
Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great
glory. And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other (Matthew 24:30-31 KJV).
This description of Jesus Christ’s return contains more punch than the
highly speculative, evolutionary, Big Bang theory. There’s no question about
it. His “coming,” or “Parousia,” will be unmistakably visible to “all the tribes
of the earth.” The dazed masses of humanity will literally “see the Son of man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” Certainly no
one will miss it, and no one will wake up the next day wondering, Which way
did the Christians go? On that awesome day, the unsaved will “mourn.” Why?
Because their loved ones have vanished? No! But because Jesus Christ has
suddenly come and their last chance for preparation is behind them. Now it’s
too late. They’re lost forever.
This entire passage also parallels Paul’s words in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17.
Just like in Paul’s description of what will happen when true believers are
“caught up,” Jesus Christ also said His coming would be a very noisy event that
will include loud reverberations from “a great sound of a trumpet” throughout
the sky. When that booming blast is heard, multitudes of shining angels will
descend into Earth’s polluted atmosphere, circle the globe, and “gather together
His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.” Thus true
believers will be “caught up” into the air. Now don’t miss it. These are the very
same elements Paul wrote about in 1 Thessalonians 4:17!
In both Matthew 24:30-31, and in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, we read
about clouds, noise, a loud trumpet, a gathering together, and true believers
being transported into the sky. When we place these sections side by side—
without prejudice or preconceived ideas—the message is unavoidable,
inescapable, and irrefutable. Both passages refer to the loud, climactic, highly
visible, and glorious second coming of Jesus Christ!
Back to Matthew 24; the Truth-teller continued:
But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of
heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so
also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before
the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
The Parousia and Twinkling Eyes
29
marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not
know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the
coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field:
one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding
at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. Watch therefore,
for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. But know
this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief
would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to
be broken into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man
is coming at an hour you do not expect (Matthew 24:36–44,
emphasis added).
Here Jesus Christ compared His return to the sudden descent of billions
of tons of water upon lost sinners in Noah’s day. Those ancient people
thought Noah was a crazy old man, until “the flood came and took them all
away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be” (Matthew 24:39, emphasis
added). Guess what Greek word is used here again for “coming”? Don’t
take my word for it; look in your own concordance. It’s “Parousia” which, as
we have already proven, unmistakably applies to the highly visible second
coming of Jesus Christ.
Now notice, immediately after Jesus described His “Parousia” in verse 39,
He continued without skipping a beat: “THEN two men will be in the field:
one will be taken and the other left” (verse 40, emphasis added). Remember,
this is the second most widely quoted verse used to buttress the secret rapture
doctrine. Supposedly, when verse 40 is fulfilled, those who are “taken” will vanish
without a trace, leaving only their clothes, shoes, false teeth, and wedding
rings, while those who are “left” will have to endure a horrific seven-year tribulation
and face the antichrist. But is this really what Jesus Christ is saying?
We don’t need to depend on scholars to find the answer. In fact, it is
never safe to lean completely on any man, no matter how smart or educated
they may be. Christians should never be taught to rely solely on Tim LaHaye,
John Walvoord, Thomas Ice, Hal Lindsey, Jack Van Impe, Grant Jeffrey,
Chuck Smith, John Hagee, or any other popular teacher, including Steve
Wohlberg. We all should open our own Bibles, pick up our own concordances,
and find out for ourselves what truth is. If you are willing to do it,
here is what you will surely find: Believers will be “taken” (verse 40) at the
“coming,” or “Parousia” (verse 39), which the Bible clearly applies to the
loud, visible, and glorious appearance of Jesus Christ at the very end of the
world (see Matthew 24:3,27,30-31,39).
Jesus basically said, “It will be just like Noah’s day” (see verses 37–39).
Now think about it. Did Noah and his family vanish before the flood? No,
they walked visibly into the ark. And what about those who were left behind
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
30
after the door of the ark was shut? Did they have a second chance? No again.
How were they left? They were left dead; they did not escape. After saying, “the
flood came, and took them all away,” Jesus made His power-packed point, “so
also will the coming [Parousia] of the Son of Man be” (verse 39). And then,
without a break, Christ said, “Then two men will be in the field: one will be
taken and the other left” (verse 40, emphasis added). Upon careful analysis,
these words leave no room for Left Behind’s ongoing saga about “tribulation
believers” resisting the antichrist during a post-rapture seven-year period.
Why not? Because those who are “taken” are transported up at the “coming,”
or “Parousia,” which applies to the final second coming of Jesus Christ!
Immediately after saying, “One will be taken and the other left,” the
King of kings then compared His second coming to the sudden arrival of a
midnight thief, just like Paul did in 1 Thessalonians 5:2-3. Jesus Christ said,
“But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief
would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken
into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you
do not expect” (Matthew 24:43-44). To “watch” doesn’t mean spending endless
hours in front of the television set, nor does it mean watching popular
movies about the end times which take detours away from the straight truth.
Rather, it means to watch out for satanic temptations and end time delusions.
Matthew 24 and 1 Thessalonians 4 and 5 fit together just as perfectly as
Adam and Eve before they sinned. Both describe a noisy, highly visible,
trumpet-blasting, and glorious return of Jesus Christ in the clouds. Both
describe believers being transported into the air.
Both declare this day will come with thief-like suddenness upon all
sleeping sinners. In Noah’s day, when billions of tons of water came crashing
down, there were no second chances for those who refused to enter the ark.
Similarly, Paul said the lost “shall not escape.” And both Paul and Matthew
use the same Greek word to describe this great and awesomely powerful “day
of the Lord.” Look in your own concordance. It’s “Parousia,” which clearly
refers to Christ’s second coming. True believers are urged to watch, be ready,
and to avoid all subtle, secretive, devilish tricks.
Before we close this chapter, let’s look at one more passage describing
an event predicted to occur “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye” (1
Corinthians 15:52). This is probably the third most quoted pro-rapture verse
used to support the idea of vanishing Christians prior to a nightmarish sevenyear
tribulation. We have previously slowed down to look at our biblical
speedometers, yet this time we must come to a screeching halt. Context, context,
context—that’s the safety zone. Notice carefully what Paul really wrote:
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall
all be changed—in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
The Parousia and Twinkling Eyes
31
last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed (1 Corinthians
15:51-52, emphasis added).
Is Paul saying believers will some day vanish while their loved ones
blink? Not at all! He is simply saying that the dead will be raised and our sinful
bodies will be changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.” When
will this “moment” take place? Paul’s answer is clear. It will occur “at the last
trumpet,” when “the trumpet will sound,” that is, at the very end of the
world. This is the very same “great sound of a trumpet” Jesus Christ said
would be heard when He finally commissions His shiny angelic friends to
gather His people at His second coming (see Matthew 24:31).
In summary, the Parousia Principle (supported by the context of
Matthew 24) proves the “one will be taken” event occurs at the final second
coming of Jesus Christ. And based on the full context of 1 Corinthians 15:52,
“the twinkling of an eye” moment similarly occurs at the end of the age.
Around April 15, even Christians sometimes need to file tax return
extensions with the Internal Revenue Service. I’ve done this myself. Such
extensions are allowed and usually approved. But to add a seven-year
extension to Jesus Christ’s words in Matthew 24:40, or to Paul’s message in
1 Corinthians 15:52 is, quite frankly, an end time delusion.
A certain minister acquired a reputation for telling his church members,
“It could be worse,” during times of great trial. One day a troubled soul told
the pastor, “Last night I dreamed Jesus came on the clouds with shiny angels.
The most horrible thing was—I was lost!” Expecting encouragement, the
minister shockingly replied, “It could be worse.” What! thought the man in
disbelief. What could be worse? Solemnly his pastor whispered, “It would be
worse if it wasn’t a dream.”
How true! Thankfully, the loving arms of Jesus Christ are still open to
lost sinners. Let’s respond to God’s goodness and the pleading voice of the
Crucified One before His visible return is not a dream.

Chapter 3
Will God?s Church Escape Tribulation?
The brightest crowns that are worn in heaven have
been tried, and smelted, and polished and glorified through
the furnaces of tribulation.
— Edwin Hubbel Chapin (1814-1880)
These two concepts come with the rapture package:
1. The Church of Jesus Christ will escape the “tribulation.”
2. Those who miss the rapture will have a second chance to
be saved.
Apart from what the Bible actually teaches about number 1, if you
think about it, number 2 can be dangerous. Some might rationalize, “If the
rapture takes place, then I’ll know God is real. Even though it may be tough,
I can still become a Christian during the tribulation and resist that antichrist
guy!” In this way, by adopting a lazy “let’s wait and see” attitude, lost sinners
may put off their decision to repent and follow Jesus Christ right now.
Die-hard, pre-tribulation supporters sometimes say, “God wouldn’t
allow His people to go through the tribulation. He loves us too much!” But
think about it. Does He love us any more than He would love after-therapture
new believers during the tribulation? No. Then why would He
allow them to go through such a horrific period, but not us? Could it be
that the idea of escaping tribulation is really only catering to our lukewarm
American tendencies? We like comfort, hate to go through trials, and can
hardly bear it when our TV-dinner lifestyle is threatened. Yet historically,
God’s people have gone through intense suffering. All the disciples of
Jesus, except John, were brutally murdered. Thousands of early Christians
33
were torn to shreds by wild dogs inside the Coliseum. Millions of others
were horribly tortured by the Inquisition and burnt to ashes during the
Dark Ages (more on this later). Believers in Russia and China have suffered
terribly under communism, and yet American Christians say, “God
wouldn’t allow us to go through the tribulation!”
When it comes to “tribulation,” once again concordances come in
handy. If you look up “tribulation” in a Strong’s or Young’s Concordance, you
may be shocked to discover that almost every reference describes what
believers suffer through. Jesus told His followers, “In the world you will have
tribulation” (John 16:33, emphasis added). Paul told his early Christian converts,
“…we must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God”
(Acts 14:22, emphasis added). Paul wrote to the church at Thessalonica,
“…we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience
and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure” (2
Thessalonians 1:4, emphasis added). On the lonely isle of Patmos, John was
our “companion in tribulation” (Revelation 1:9, emphasis added). Jesus told
His church in Smyrna, “I know your works [and] tribulation…” (Revelation
2:9, emphasis added). In the light of these Scriptures, the idea of Christians
escaping tribulation seems like fantasy and illusion.
Some might respond by saying, “Yes, but those verses are talking about
‘tribulation,’ not ‘the tribulation.’ ” Again, just think about it. If the majority
of the Bible’s “tribulation texts” refer to what believers go through, why would
God’s Word suddenly shift gears by teaching that “the tribulation” is something
believers will not go through? Even in Left Behind, there are after-therapture
Christians who go through “the Tribulation.” Jerry B. Jenkins calls
them “the Tribulation Force.” Therefore the thought of Christians going
through this period is not so strange.
Many pro-rapture advocates also argue, “If the Church is going through
the tribulation, then why isn’t the Church mentioned after Revelation 4?” Let’s
take a closer look. In Revelation 4:1, John was told to “come up here.” People
conclude this represents the rapture and they think the Church isn’t mentioned
anymore. First of all, John did not actually go to Heaven in Revelation 4:1; he
was simply taken up in a vision, while his toes remained on Patmos. Secondly,
the Church is on Earth after Revelation 4. How do we know this? Because
Revelation says the beast will make “war with the saints” (13:7), then we read
about “the faith of the saints” (13:10), and finally, during the mark of the beast
crisis, the apocalypse refers to “the saints” who keep “the faith of Jesus” (14:12).
Some may respond by saying, “Those are the tribulation saints after
the rapture, not the Church.” But consider this. Paul wrote his New
Testament letters to the “churches of the saints” (1 Corinthians 14:33).
What does this tell us? Wherever there are saints, there is the Church! Even
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
34
if the saints mentioned in Revelation 13 and 14 are only the tribulation
saints after the rapture, wouldn’t they, as sincere believers in Jesus Christ,
still be the Church?
Rapture teachers contend the Church won’t be here for Armageddon.
Is this true? The word “Armageddon” is used only once in the entire Bible,
in Revelation 16:16, which is the great chapter about the falling of the seven
last plagues. Right before verse 16, during the time of the plagues, Jesus Christ
thunders, “Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and
keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame. And they
gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon”
(Revelation 16:15-16).
Did you catch that? Who is Jesus talking to? To the Church! At the time
of verse 15, while the seven plagues are falling, which is definitely during the
tribulation, and right before the battle of Armageddon, Jesus Christ has not yet
come as a thief! Therefore He must come like a thief at Armageddon, after the
tribulation, and this must be the time when He comes to gather His Church.
Like a good commanding officer, Paul urged the soldiers of the cross,
“Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand
in the evil day, and having done all, to stand” (Ephesians 6:13). We are
to stand in “the evil day.” How can we, if we have previously disappeared?
Jesus Christ also said, “But he who endures to the end shall be saved”
(Matthew 24:13). How long must we endure? To the end.
What about the “second chance” idea? First of all, God has given every
one of us more than “a second chance.” When we sin and resist His love, He
gives us countless chances to make a full surrender to His grace. The message
of the gospel is continually sounding to sinners, “Christ died for our sins” (1
Corinthians 15:3); “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved”
(Acts 16:31); “Repent, and believe in the gospel” (Mark 1:15). But eventually,
God’s patience will wear out and the Angel of Mercy will take his final
flight. Humanity will have passed “the hidden boundary between God’s
patience and His wrath.”
Paul wrote that all who are not fully on the Lord’s side when true believers
are “caught up…shall not escape” (1 Thessalonians 4:17; 5:3). For them,
their second, third, tenth, and ten-thousandth chances are over. Jesus also
said, “But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man
be” (Matthew 24:37). After the door of the ark closed, all desperate attempts
to get inside were useless. It was too late. Paul also wrote, “Now is the day of
salvation” (2 Corinthians 6:2, emphasis added). Friend, this is it. Don’t put off
your decision to follow Jesus Christ. If you are not “caught up” when the Lord
descends from Heaven with a shout, you will have blown it, big time, forever.
Will God’s Church Escape Tribulation?
35
Here’s one more key thought before we close this chapter. If the pretribulation
rapture doctrine is false, this obviously means we ourselves—if
we are alive at that time—must not only pass through Earth’s final tribulation,
but must also face the antichrist and his deadly mark (see
Revelation 14:9-10). Here’s the biggest problem. Many Christians are
deeply afraid of this. Thus it seems that fear—a fear of the beast—often
underlies many desperate efforts to maintain the shaky pre-tribulation rapture
position.
This reminds me of the tragic deaths of 118 crewmen inside the giant
Russian nuclear submarine, Kursk. On Saturday, August 12, 2000, way out in
the icy waters of the Barents Sea, east-northeast of Moscow, something went
terribly wrong. An explosion took place, followed by another. The “catastrophe
developed at lightning speed,”2 and the doomed sub quickly sank to the
bottom of the ocean. Newsweek ran a story on this called, “A Cry from the
Deep.” Twenty-three Russians survived the initial blasts and flooding. A letter
was later found by deep-sea divers inside a pocket of one of the corpses.
“There are 23 people here…None of us can get to the surface.”3 Because help
didn’t come quickly enough, they all died. As I have thought about this horrible
tragedy, I can imagine the feeling of fear in the hearts of those hopelessly
trapped Russian sailors deep down below the calm surface of the water.
From what I’ve seen, fear also often lurks below the pre-tribulation rapture
doctrine. Deep down underneath the surface of many arguments lies the hidden
scary thought of having to endure the time of trouble and face the beast. This
fear may be unconscious, yet often it is there, and it seems to prevent people
from being open-minded enough to even consider another viewpoint. Emotions
fly high and many refuse to reasonably examine the clear scriptural evidence in
favor of a post-tribulation gathering of the Church to Jesus Christ.
Sadly, the pre-tribulation rapture doctrine has become the great evangelical
escape clause for the avoidance of the end times. And for those who
must have it this way, no amount of evidence will convince them otherwise.
Like a triple-bolted door in downtown New York, they are simply closed to
the facts. The result? Truth is left behind.
Christians should learn a lesson from popular bumper stickers and
trendy T-shirts which say, “No Fear.” The truth is, we don’t need to be afraid,
for Jesus Christ has promised, “I am with you always, even to the end of the
age” (Matthew 28:20). “God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and
of love and of a sound mind” (2 Timothy 1:7).
Afraid of the dark, a little girl once asked her father if she could sleep
in his bedroom. “Of course, honey,” he replied. Lying next to him with the
lights out, she was still afraid. “Daddy, is your face turned toward me?” “Yes
dear, now go to sleep.”

SEVEN-YEAR TRIBULATION
DELUSIONS

Chapter 4
The Seven-Year Tribulation Theory
A man who has committed a mistake and doesn’t correct
it is committing another mistake.
— Confucius (551-479 B.C.)
If the Rapture Delusions section in this book is true, then what about
“the seven years”? The concept of a seven-year period of tribulation is actually
the underlying foundation of the entire Left Behind scenario (and all other
pro-rapture books and movies). Again, the theory is: rapture first, then seven
years of horror.
Book Two of the Left Behind novels declares, “The disappearances
have ushered in the seven year period of Tribulation” (The Tribulation
Force, inside cover). Book Three reveals, “…the seven-year Tribulation is
nearing the end of its first quarter…” (Nicolae, inside cover). Book Six
tells us, “It’s the midpoint of the seven-year Tribulation” (The Indwelling,
inside cover). Book Eight begins with, “…the dawn of the second half of
the seven-year Tribulation” (The Mark, inside cover). Book Eleven opens
“six years into the Tribulation, two and one-half years into the Great
Tribulation” (Armageddon, p. vii). Thus this New York Times, USA-Today,
and Wall Street Journal bestselling series of end times prophecy books,
endorsed by well-respected church leaders worldwide, is built entirely
around this seven-year framework.
Where does this “seven-year” concept come from anyway? It may
shock you, but if you look for “seven years of tribulation” in any concordance,
you won’t find it. The truth is, from Genesis to Revelation, there
is no exact passage that specifically mentions a seven-year period of
tribulation at all. Amazingly, the entire theory is really based on a rather
speculative interpretation of two little words in one single verse. The
text is Daniel 9:27; and the two words are, “one week.” Let me explain.
The Book of Daniel was written while the Jews were in Babylon—in
exile because of their sins. Daniel 9:24-27 contains a prophecy from the angel
Gabriel to encourage the Jewish people that they would be given a “second
chance” to return to Jerusalem, rebuild their temple, and ultimately, receive
their Messiah (Jesus Christ).
This highly controversial prophecy literally reads:
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy
holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of
sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy,
and to anoint the most Holy. Know therefore and understand,
that from the going forth of the commandment to restore
and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be
seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks [62 weeks]: the
street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous
times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut
off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall
come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end
thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations
are determined. And he shall confirm the covenant with
many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause
the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading
of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the
consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the
desolate (Daniel 9:24-27 KJV).
Thus we have a prophecy about “seventy weeks.” Gabriel then subdivides
the period into three smaller periods of seven weeks (verse 25), sixtytwo
weeks (verse 25), and one week (verse 27). 7+62+1=70.
Seventy weeks = 490 days. A day in prophecy represents a year (see
Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6). Thus 490 days are really 490 years.
Without going into all the chronological details here (I will get more
specific in a later chapter), the prophecy starts with a direct “commandment
to restore and to build Jerusalem” (verse 25) after the Babylonian
captivity and reaches down to the first coming of Jesus Christ. After 69
weeks (after 483 years), “shall Messiah be cut off” (verse 26). All
Christian scholars apply this to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. After our
Lord’s agonizing death, “the people of the prince that shall come shall
destroy the city and the sanctuary” (verse 26). While there are differences
of opinion as to who “the people of the prince” refers to, the
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
40
majority of scholars nevertheless apply the destruction of “the city and
the sanctuary” to the second destruction of Jerusalem and its rebuilt
sanctuary by Roman armies under Prince Titus in 70 A.D.
So far, we have seen 69 weeks fulfilled. That leaves “one week” left, otherwise
known as the famous “70th week of Daniel.” Again, that highly controversial
text literally says:
And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and
in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation
to cease… (Daniel 9:27 KJV).
Based on the day-year principle (which is valid), the “one week”
remaining in this prophecy must refer to a period of seven years. Pro-rapture
promoters claim this is the seven-year period of tribulation. Their idea is that
while the first 69 weeks (or 483 years) did reach to the first coming of Jesus
Christ, the prophetic clock has stopped because the Jewish people largely
rejected Him. Then they slide the 70th week (the last seven years) all the
way down to the end times, call it the tribulation, and say it applies to the
Jewish people after we’re gone.
Rapture teachers interpret Daniel 9:27 as follows:
1. “He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.”
“He” is the antichrist who will make a covenant (or peace
treaty) with the Jews during the seven years of tribulation.
2. “In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and
the oblation to cease…” In the middle of the seven-year
tribulation, the antichrist will break his covenant, turn
against Israel, and stop their animal sacrifices.
3. The phrase, “he shall cause the sacrifice…to cease” is
viewed as irrefutable proof that a Jewish temple (which
includes sacrifices) must be rebuilt on the Temple Mount
inside Jerusalem.
Bestselling author Hal Lindsey in his The Late Great Planet Earth
reflects this current view when he writes about “God’s last seven years of
dealing with the Jewish people before the long awaited setting up of the
kingdom of God (Daniel 9:27).”4 According to Mr. Lindsey, during those
seven years “ ‘the Antichrist,’ breaks his covenant with the Jewish people
and causes the Jewish temple worship, according to the Law of Moses, to
cease (Daniel 9:27)…We must conclude that a third Temple will be
rebuilt upon its ancient site in old Jerusalem.”5
Therefore, according to countless modern interpreters, Daniel 9:27 is
applied to a future antichrist, a future peace treaty made with Israel, a
The Seven-Year Tribulation Theory
41
future seven-year tribulation, and a future rebuilt Jewish temple inside
Jerusalem. And all of this will supposedly start with the rapture. Honestly,
that’s a lot to interpret from that single verse, especially when Daniel 9:27
says absolutely nothing about any seven-year tribulation, antichrist, or rebuilt
Jewish temple!
Could there be something wrong with this picture?

Chapter 5
Dropping the Bomb
A lie can travel halfway around the world while the
truth is still putting on its shoes.
— Mark Twain (1835-1910)
Prophecy-minded Christians all over Planet Earth sometimes engage in
a fierce debate about whether Jesus Christ will return for His Church before
the seven years of tribulation (the “pre-trib” view), in the middle of the seven
years (the “mid-trib” view), or at the end of the seven years (the “post-trib”
view). Yet by far the most explosive question too few seem to be asking is: “Is
an end-time ‘seven-year period of tribulation’ really the correct interpretation
of Daniel 9:27 in the first place?”
In 1945, after months of agonizing deliberation, U.S. President Harry
Truman finally issued orders to drop two atomic bombs upon Japan in an
attempt to end World War II. On August 6, the “Little Boy” fell on Hiroshima.
Three days later, the “Fat Man” was released over Nagasaki. Approximately
130,000 people were instantly vaporized. Many heated discussions have
occurred as to whether or not it was the right thing to drop those bombs. One
thing’s for sure, in the minds of those who made that fearful decision, they
believed it was for the ultimate good of America.
Dear friend, it is for the benefit of Christians everywhere that God’s
bomb of truth should now be released over what I have come to call, “The
70th week of Daniel Delusion.”
As we have already seen, Daniel 9:27 literally says:
43
He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the
midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
cease… (Daniel 9:27 KJV).
This may shock you, but historically, the vast majority of well-respected
Bible scholars have not applied Daniel 9:27 to a seven-year period of tribulation
at all. Neither have they interpreted the “he” as referring to a future Mr.
Deadly. Instead, they applied it to Jesus Christ.
Notice what the world-famous Bible commentary written by Matthew
Henry says about Daniel 9:27: “By offering himself a sacrifice once and for all
he [Jesus] shall put an end to all the Levitical sacrifices.”6 Thus Matthew
Henry applied Daniel 9:27 to Christ, not antichrist. Another famous commentary
written by British Methodist Adam Clarke says that during Daniel
9:27’s “term of seven years,” Jesus Himself would “confirm or ratify the new
covenant with mankind.”7 Another dusty Bible commentary reveals: “He
shall confirm the covenant—Christ. The confirmation of the covenant is
assigned to Him.”8
Here’s one more statement from a book called, Christ and Antichrist,
published in 1846 by the Presbyterian Board of Publication in Philadelphia.
On page 2, under Recommendations, are endorsements from many
Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist ministers, including an official representative
of the Southern Baptist Convention.9 Commenting on the final
week of Daniel 9:27, that ancient volume states:
…sometime during the remaining seven, he [the
Messiah] was to die as a sacrifice for sin, and thus bring in
“everlasting righteousness.” Here are allusions to events so
palpable, that one would think, the people among whom
they occurred, could not possibly have misapplied the
prophecy.10
Okay, here we go. The following ten points provide logical and convincing
evidence that Daniel’s famous 70th week has no application to any
future seven-year tribulation at all. Rather, this great prophetic period was
definitely fulfilled nearly two thousand years ago.
1. The entire prophecy of Daniel 9:24-27 covers a period of
“seventy weeks.” Logic requires that “seventy weeks”
refers to one consecutive block of time, in other words, to
seventy straight sequential weeks. The truth is, there is no
example in Scripture (or anywhere else!) of a stated time
period starting, stopping, and then starting again. All biblical
references to time are consecutive: 40 days and 40
nights (see Genesis 7:4), 400 years in Egypt (see Genesis
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
44
15:13), 70 years of captivity (see Daniel 9:2), etc. In
Daniel’s prophecy, the “seventy weeks” were to begin during
the reign of Persia and continue to the time of the
Messiah.
2. Logic also requires that the 70th week follow immediately
after the 69th week. If it doesn’t, then it cannot properly
be called the 70th week!
3. It is illogical to insert a 2,000-year gap between the 69th
and 70th week. No hint of a gap is found in the prophecy
itself. There is no gap between the first seven weeks and
the following sixty-two weeks, so why insert one between
the 69th and 70th week?
Note: If you told your child to be in bed in 70 minutes, you
obviously would mean 70 consecutive minutes. What if five
hours later your fully awake son said, “But dad, I know 69
minutes have passed, but the 70th minute hasn’t started
yet!”? After receiving an appropriate punishment, he
would be swiftly sent to bed.
4. Daniel 9:27 says nothing about a seven-year period of
“tribulation,” a “rebuilt” Jewish temple, or any
“antichrist.”
5. The stated focus of this prophecy is the Messiah, not the
antichrist. After the Messiah is “cut off” (referring to
Christ’s death), the text says, “And the people of the
prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.”
In the past, this has been consistently applied to
the destruction of Jerusalem and the second temple by
Roman armies led by Prince Titus in A.D. 70.11
6. “He shall confirm the covenant.” Paul said “the covenant”
was “confirmed before by God in Christ” (Galatians 3:17).
Jesus Christ came “to confirm the promises made to the
fathers” (Romans 15:8, emphasis added). In the King
James Version, Daniel 9:27 doesn’t say “a covenant” or
peace treaty, but “the covenant,” which applies to the New
Covenant. Nowhere in the Bible does the antichrist
make, confirm, or break a covenant with anyone. The
word “covenant” is Messianic, and always applies to the
Messiah, not the antichrist.
7. “He shall confirm the covenant with many.” Jesus Christ
said, “This is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed
Dropping the Bomb
45
for many…” (Matthew 26:28). Behold a perfect fit! Jesus
was quoting Daniel 9:27 specifically.
8. “In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and
the oblation to cease.” After exactly three and a half years
of holy ministry, Jesus Christ died on the cross, “in the
midst of the week [in the middle of the seven years].” At
the exact moment of His death, “the veil of the temple
was torn in two from top to bottom…” (Matthew 27:51).
This act of God signified that all animal sacrifices at that
moment ceased to be of value. Why? Because the Perfect
Sacrifice had been offered!
9. “For the overspreading of abominations he shall make it
desolate.” “The abomination of desolation” (see Matthew
24:15) is not a simple subject, yet we know that Jesus
clearly applied this event to the time when His followers
were to flee from Jerusalem before the destruction of the
second temple in A.D. 70. In a parallel text to Matthew
24:15, Jesus told His disciples, “When you see Jerusalem
surrounded by armies [Roman armies led by Prince Titus],
then know that its desolation is near” (Luke 21:20, emphasis
added). The disciples did “see” those very events. Because
of the “abominations” of the Pharisees, Jesus told them,
“See! Your house is left to you desolate” (Matthew 23:38).
Thus Gabriel’s statement in Daniel 9:27 about Jerusalem
becoming “desolate” was perfectly fulfilled in A.D. 70.
10. Gabriel said that the 70-week prophecy specifically
applied to the Jewish people (see Daniel 9:24). During
the period of Christ’s public ministry of 31/2 years, the
Master’s focus was largely upon “the lost sheep of the
house of Israel” (Matthew 10:6). After His resurrection
and then for another 31/2 years, His disciples preached
mostly to Jews (see Acts 1-6). After that second 31/2-year
period, in 34 A.D., the bold Stephen was stoned by the
Jewish Sanhedrin (see Acts 7). This infamous deed
marked the then-ruling Jewish leaders’ final, official
rejection of the gospel of our Savior. Then the gospel
went to the Gentiles. In Acts 9, Saul became Paul, the
“apostle to the Gentiles” (Romans 11:13). In Acts 10,
God gave Peter a vision revealing it was now time to
preach to the Gentiles (see Acts 10:1-28). Read also
Acts 13:46. Thus approximately 31/2 years after the crucifixion—
and at the end of the 70-week prophecy given
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
46
for the Jewish people—the gospel shifted to the
Gentiles exactly as predicted in Bible prophecy.
The explosive evidence is overwhelming! Point by point the events of
Daniel’s 70th week have been fulfilled in the past. These eight words found
in Daniel 9:27: “confirm…covenant…many…midst…sacrifice…cease…
abominations…desolate” all find perfect fulfillment in Jesus Christ and early
Christian history.
In the words of that 1846 Presbyterian publication,
The seventy weeks of Daniel therefore, have certainly
ended many centuries ago. We are not to look to the future
for the fulfillment of these predictions. We must look to the
past. And if to the past; where is there one who can have any
adequate claims to being the subject of these prophecies, but
Jesus? He, and he only can claim them; and to him they most
certainly refer.12
…one would think, the people [the Jews] among whom
[these events] occurred, could not possibly have misapplied
the prophecy. 13
But they did. In fact, one major reason why the Jewish nation as a whole
failed to receive its Messiah was because its scholars misinterpreted Daniel
9:27. They failed to see Jesus Christ as the predicted One who would die in the
midst of the 70th week! Amazingly, the exact same thing is happening today.
Sincere Christian scholars are now misapplying the very same prophecy.
The entire “seven-year period of tribulation” theory is an end time
delusion, a massive mega-myth. It may even go down in history as the
“greatest evangelical misinterpretation of all time.” The whole concept is
like a gigantic bubble. Once Daniel 9:27 is correctly understood and the
sharply-pointed pin of truth is inserted, “Pop goes the seven years!” It’s a
fact: There is no text in the Bible which teaches a “seven-year tribulation.”
If you hunt for it, you’ll end up like Ponce de Leon searching for the
mystical Fountain of Youth, but never finding it.
The current debate and tremendous confusion over pre-trib, mid-trib,
or post-trib is really a smoke screen of the enemy to hide the real issue. What
is the real issue? We’ll find out when we study what the Book of Revelation
truly teaches about Israel, Babylon the Great, and Armageddon.

There it sat, inside an airport newsstand in Atlanta. I didn’t have much
time to catch my connection to Canada, but the magazine cover grabbed my
attention immediately. Time magazine, July 1, 2002. Flames surrounded a
large cross with these words emblazoned: “THE BIBLE & THE APOCALYPSE,
Why more Americans are reading and talking about THE END OF
THE WORLD.”
I paid the $3.95.
On the plane I read the cover story titled, “APOCALYPSE NOW,”
highlighting the surge of American interest in deciphering biblical prophecies
after the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in
New York City. Raptureready.com was featured, an incredibly popular website
whose webmaster has invented the “Rapture Index,” calling it a “Dow
Jones Industrial Average of End Time activity.”14 On September 24, 2001, 13
days after 9-11, the site’s “bandwidth nearly melted under the weight of 8
million visitors.”
The article’s center spread showed full-color pictures of every Left
Behind book, with the words “COPIES SOLD” written under each book: “Left
Behind, 7,000,000…Tribulation Force, 4,100,000…Desecration, 3,100,000,”
etc. Below was a box labeled, “GLOSSARY OF TERMS,” defining apocalyptic
phraseology for the average Joe. I was especially interested to see how
49
“THE TRIBULATION” was defined: “A period of seven years of disaster that
will end with Christ’s defeat of evil at Armageddon.”15
“MEET THE PROPHET” was the title of another four-page story a few
pages in. Dead center was a large photograph of Tim LaHaye preaching, with
“Taking his message to the masses,” as the subheading. The next page showed
Jerry B. Jenkins standing next to a sidebar picturing “LEFT BEHIND Wares,”
including comic books, a kids series, and a Monopoly-style Left Behind board
game. All of the Time articles described a heightened interest in prophecy—
especially among evangelical Christians—and spelled out the popular views
being critiqued in this book: rapture first, seven-year tribulation next, during
which Mr. Wicked appears and attacks the Jews.
Except for one article. Page 46. Its intriguing title was, “The End:
How It Got That Way,” by David Van Biema. My heart started pounding…
Could it be?…Below the headline was a little picture (maybe 1 by
1.5 inches, smaller than those of LaHaye, Jenkins, and each Left Behind
book) of a curious-looking man named John Nelson Darby who lived in
England during the 1800’s. An obvious student of history, Van Biema
referred to Mr. Darby as “The man with the plan” to introduce into 19thcentury
British and American Christianity “a radical new eschatology”
which included believing in “a seven-year, hell-like Tribulation.” I could
scarce believe my eyes!
Tucked within that article appeared this shocking paragraph from Van
Biema’s insightful pen:
His [Darby] most striking innovation was the timing of
a concept called the Rapture, drawn from the Apostle Paul’s
prediction that believers would fly up to meet Christ in
heaven. Most theologians understood it as part of the
Resurrection at time’s very end, Darby repositioned it at the
Apocalypse’s very beginning, a small shift with large implications.
It spared true believers the Tribulation, leaving the
horror to nonbelievers and the doctrinally misled…Darby’s
scheme became a pillar of the new Fundamentalism.16
Do you realize what you just read? Based on solid historical research,
David reported to millions of Time readers that John Nelson Darby’s “most
striking innovation” was to take Paul’s “caught up” phrase in 1 Thessalonians
4:17 and “reposition it” at the beginning of the “Tribulation”—“a small shift
with large implications.” In the early 1800’s, “most theologians” didn’t see it
that way; yet slowly over time, “Darby’s scheme became a pillar of the new
Fundamentalism.”

This “pillar” now supports the entire Left Behind infrastructure.
Unknown to modern fans, the pillar is not Scripture but Darbyism, even
though Bible texts are used to support and proof-text the doctrine.
In God’s Word, it’s not rapture-tribulation-end at all. Daniel’s 70th
week is history and true believers will be “caught up” at the loud, visible, second
coming of Jesus Christ. As David Van Biema correctly reported in Time,
this is what “most theologians” have taught for centuries! But times have
changed; and now, sadly, Left Behind is all “caught up” with the innovations
of J.N. Darby.
Now you know more about “The End: How It Got That Way.”

Chapter 7
Antichrist: Facts vs. Fiction
Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of
them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever
happened.
— Winston Churchill (1874-1965)
Having been raised in Los Angeles, I always understood the possibility
that the “Big One”—an earthquake above 7.5—might devastate our city if
the San Andreas Fault suddenly gave way and shifted forcefully. When it
comes to biblical prophecy, the “Big One” is definitely the topic of the
antichrist. Let me warn you in advance. Get ready for some shocks.
“ ‘He’s probably a good looking man,’ says Kelly Sellers, who runs a decorative-
stone business in Minneapolis, Minn. ‘I’m sure he’s in politics right
now and probably in the public eye even a little bit.’ Sellers has read every
Left Behind book and is waiting for the next one—‘anxiously.’ ”17 This was in
the Time issue referenced in the last chapter. Seller’s view agrees with the
“GLOSSARY OF TERMS” which defines “ANTICHRIST” as “An evil figure
who will plague the world and eventually be defeated by Christ in the
battle of Armageddon.”18
Like most prophecy-minded Christians today, Kelly Sellers thinks the
antichrist will be one super Bad Guy who will publicly appear after the rapture.
In the Left Behind series, storyteller Jerry B. Jenkins gives this antichrist
a name, Nicolae Carpathia. In another sequence of end time thriller movies—
Apocalypse, Revelation, Tribulation, and Judgment—the name of the antichrist
is Franco Macalousso. With a creative twist going beyond other films,
Megiddo: Omega Code 2, portrays the antichrist (his name is Stone
Alexander) from boyhood on up, and even has him falling in love and getting
55
married. Unfortunately for Mr. Alexander’s beautiful bride, she eventually discovers
her dashing lover to be the devilish incarnation of lucifer himself.
What does the Bible really teach about this mysterious subject? The
word “antichrist,” or “antichrists,” is found only five times in Scripture, and
all of these references are in two small books right before the Book of
Revelation. The two little books are 1st and 2nd John. The exact verses are
1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; and 2 John 7. That’s it. When we read these verses (and
others near them), we certainly don’t read about any Mr. Sly falling in love
and getting married. On the contrary, we find:
1 John 2:18—The early Christians had heard that antichrist
was coming.
1 John 2:18—Even now there are many antichrists.
1 John 2:18—This is evidence that the last time has come.
1 John 2:19—These many antichrists “went out from us.”
1 John 2:22—Anyone who denies the Father and the Son is
antichrist.
1 John 2:26—These antichrists are trying to seduce us away
from Jesus Christ.
1 John 4:3—There is a spirit of antichrist.
1 John 4:3—The spirit of antichrist denies Jesus Christ has
come in the flesh.
1 John 4:3—The spirit of antichrist is already in the world.
1 John 4:4—True Christians must overcome every form of
antichrist.
1 John 4:6—The spirit of antichrist is the spirit of error.
2 John 7—There are many deceivers and antichrists in the
world.
2 John 9—To overcome these antichrists, Christians must
abide in the doctrine of Christ.
After an objective look, what have we discovered? Do any of these verses
describe a solitary Mr. Sin who only shows up after we’re gone? Definitely
not! The Word of God describes not just one, but many antichrists. And
according to 1 John 2:19, these many antichrists “went out from us,” which
means out from inside of the Christian church! They are subtle, deceptive, and
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
56
at war with true Christians. They may profess a certain faith in Jesus, yet their
faith is superficial. They actually deny the Father and the Son (see 1 John
2:22,26). There is also a spirit of antichrist, called “the spirit of error,” which
is now in the world (see 1 John 4:3). According to the Bible, the goal of these
many antichrists and of the spirit of antichrist is to deceive Christians away
from God’s love, from the gospel, and from the true doctrine of Jesus Christ
(see 2 John 7,9). Just like America is now at war with terrorists, even so must
genuine Christians do battle with these spiritual enemies of truth; and in the
strength of Christ, overcome them (see 1 John 4:4).
This is everything God’s Word actually says about “antichrist,”
“antichrists,” and “the spirit of antichrist.” Now don’t miss this point. None
of these insightful passages point toward one Mr. Malignant—like Nicolae
Carpathia, Stone Alexander, or Franco Macalousso—who appears as a cunning
politician only after we’re gone. The truth is quite different. In reality,
they all refer to seductive and deceiving elements which are here now and
which true Christians must face and overcome.
It’s true, God’s Book reveals other prophecies about the emergence
of an evil “little horn” (Daniel 7:8), a dreadful “beast” (Revelation 13:1),
and “the man of sin” (2 Thessalonians 2:3). It is primarily these prophecies
that are now being used to support the idea of a future Mr.
Abominable—one who will rise up outside of Christianity after the rapture.
Yet consider this. The definite trend of the Bible’s literal
“antichrist” passages clearly points to things that are here now and which
true Christians must face and overcome. So why would its other
antichrist prophecies about the “little horn,” “the man of sin,” and “the
beast,” suddenly reverse this trend and apply to things which Christians
will not face because they will first vanish in the rapture?
A few years ago I held a prophecy seminar in Corinth, Mississippi. En
route by plane, I landed in Memphis, Tennessee. After picking up my
Thrifty rental car, I asked for directions to Corinth. “Take this map,” the
attendant said calmly. “Get on I-55 and head south. You’ll get there by and
by.” I had no reason to doubt. Trustingly, I was soon rolling down Highway
55. But after 20 minutes or so a still small voice started impressing my conscience
to check the map for myself. At first, I ignored the voice. Finally,
I reached over and took a look. To my amazement, I discovered that I-55
was heading straight south to Jackson, Mississippi, while Corinth was dead
east! I turned around, went back to Memphis, got on the right road, and
finally made it to my seminar.
I learned this lesson: No matter how much I trust someone who gives
me directions, I must check the map for myself. The same thing applies to
the subject of the antichrist. We may trust that today’s much-respected
Antichrist: Facts vs. Fiction
57
prophecy teachers know their stuff and won’t lead us astray, but in the
final analysis, we must look to God’s Map (the Bible) for ourselves. So far,
as we have done this, we’ve seen that all of the Word’s clear “antichrist”
statements apply to deceptive elements inside of Christianity—elements we
must face and overcome. But most bestselling prophecy books don’t tell us
this. As you continue down the end time delusions highway, checking God’s
Map closely and listening for His voice, you will discover many other
things you won’t learn at the movies.

Paul?s Point: Antichrist Comes First
For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe,
the horse was lost; for want of a horse, the rider was lost; for
want of the rider, the battle was lost.
—Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)
What the majority think is often wrong. People thought the Titanic was
unsinkable, yet she sank like lead. Many believed the infamous Y2K computer
glitch would spark a global economic meltdown as the world’s clocks
ticked over to 2000 A.D., yet January 1 arrived with hardly a hiccup.
Starstruck lovers race to the marriage altar fully expecting a lifetime of bliss,
yet after a few short days reality often hits like a boxer’s glove to the nose. It’s
obvious, isn’t it? What we humans think will happen often fails to occur.
When it comes to the arena of Bible prophecy, how many mistakes are
being made? As we have already seen, at this very moment, millions of
Christians fully expect to vanish in the rapture before the antichrist arrives.
Again, the idea is: first the rapture, then the antichrist. This sequence is being
taught around the world in books, magazines, seminars, on radio, television,
in pulpits, and on the Internet.
As we saw earlier, the most quoted verse about the rapture is 1 Thessalonians
4:17. There Paul wrote that true believers will someday be “caught
up.” In Paul’s second letter written to the same group, he referred to the
same event as, “the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering
together to Him” (2 Thessalonians 2:1). In his second letter, immediately
after describing “our gathering” to the Lord, Paul wrote about something or
someone that is clearly antichrist (verse 3). The question is: What did Paul
teach about the sequence of events? Did he say the Church would be gath-
59
ered to Jesus Christ before the antichrist comes, or will antichrist come
first, before we are gathered to the Savior? Amazingly, Paul gives us a
straight answer, and his answer is not what the majority of prophecyminded
Christians think!
Look closely. Paul wrote:
Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, not to be soon
shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter,
as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come. Let no
one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless
the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the
son of perdition (2 Thessalonians 2:1-3, emphasis added).
Do you realize what you just read? Paul’s words are quite penetrating
when it comes to the issue of which comes first, “our gathering” or the
appearance of antichrist.
Here is a more detailed analysis of 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3:
Verse 1: Paul wrote about “the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ and our gathering together to Him.” This is obviously
the same event as the descent of Jesus Christ from Heaven
and our being “caught up together” to meet Him in the air
(1 Thessalonians 4:17). It’s important to realize that the
Greek word for “coming” in verse 1 is none other than our
old friend “Parousia,” which we have seen clearly applies to
the visible second coming of Jesus Christ (see Matthew
24:27). The exact same word is used in verse 8 describing
“the brightness of His coming [Parousia].”
Verse 2: Here Paul addressed a distortion about the timing
of the coming of the Lord that was confusing the early
Church. He urged the Thessalonians not to be “soon shaken,”
or “troubled,” by false influences which were teaching,
either by “word,” or “spirit,” or “letter,” that “the day of
Christ had [already] come,” or, as the King James Version
puts it, was “at hand” in the first century. Because of this false
teaching that “the day of Christ” was just around the corner
in their own day, some of the Thessalonian Christians had
quit their jobs, stopped providing for their families, and were
just hanging around in idle expectancy waiting for Christ’s
imminent appearance (see 2 Thessalonians 3:10-12).
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
60
Verse 3: Paul clarified the truth with this warning, “Let
no one deceive you by any means; for that Day [when Jesus
comes to gather us—verse 1] will not come unless the falling
away comes first, and that man of sin is revealed, the son of
perdition.”
Did you catch that? Verse 3 is pointed and clear. Paul wrote that before
Jesus Christ comes to “gather” His people to Himself, “the falling away” and
the rise of “the son of perdition” (the antichrist) must come first. Thus to
those early Thessalonian believers, Paul’s message was that “the day of
Christ” was not just around the corner. Something big must happen first.
And to us who live in the 21st century, Paul’s message is equally clear: Before
Jesus Christ comes to “gather” us, “the falling away comes first” and the
antichrist must be revealed. Paul directly, specifically, and earnestly warned
the Church not to be deceived about this very thing! Evidently he knew satan
would work hard to dupe the saints in this exact area.
When we put these pieces together, it becomes super clear that before
“the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him”
(verse 1), “the falling away comes first” and the antichrist must be revealed.
Therefore, contrary to current popular opinion, it’s antichrist first, and then
the Church is “caught up,” not the other way around.
Paul’s voice echoes down through the corridors of many centuries: “Let
no one deceive you by any means” (2 Thessalonians 2:3).
I know, many don’t agree with this. But remember, people also thought
the Titanic was unsinkable.

Chapter 9
Falling Away From the Truth
The truth does not change according to our ability to
stomach it.
— Flannery O’Connor (1925-1964)
Millions of Christians are now being taught that the antichrist will be
some evil person who will rise into power outside of Christianity after the
rapture. But think with me for a moment. What if this idea is a horrible mistake?
What if the antichrist rises up inside of Christianity before the Church
is caught up to Christ? Because few would be looking for an antichrist within,
can you imagine what kind of harm he could do? Hold onto your seats, for
you are about to discover Paul taught this very thing.
Paul wrote, “Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day [when
Jesus comes to gather us—verse 1] will not come unless the falling away
comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition” (2
Thessalonians 2:3). Almost everyone agrees these words predict the rise of
the antichrist. What many have missed is that Paul is describing an antichrist
that rises in the wake of “the falling away.” What does this mean? Once
again, a little knowledge of Greek comes in handy. The original word Paul
used for “the falling away,” is apostasia, which literally means an apostasy or
departure from Jesus Christ inside the Christian Church. In fact, many versions
of the New King James Bible place the heading, “The Great Apostasy,”
right above 2 Thessalonians 2. To illustrate the connection between “the
falling away,” and the rising up of the antichrist, imagine a boy who climbs a
tree, stands on a branch, loses his footing, and then “falls away.” After banging
his head on the ground, a large bump starts growing on his forehead.
Surely you can see the connection between the boy “falling away” from the
63
limb and the rising of the bump. It’s the same with “the falling away” and the
rising of the antichrist. As we are about to see, this “falling away” unquestionably
takes place inside the church.
In the first century, the Christian church remained relatively pure from
heresy, false doctrine, and open sin. But with His cosmic perspective, God
saw a change would come, and He revealed this sober reality to the writers of
the New Testament. A brief survey of the following Bible passages shows
plainly that an apostasy, departure, or “falling away” from Jesus Christ was
predicted to occur inside of Christianity. I call this, “The Big Detour.”
1. Acts 20: Paul told “the elders of the church” of Ephesus
(vs. 17) that soon many false Christian leaders would rise
up from among themselves to “draw away the disciples”
after them (vs. 30). He was so burdened about this coming
apostasy that he warned the church “night and day with
tears” (vs. 31).
2. 1 Timothy 4: The Holy Spirit clearly warned that “some
will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits
and doctrines of demons” (vs. 1). Here again is a predicted
departure from the faith inside the church.
3. 2 Timothy 4: Paul predicted a time would come when
many in the church would no longer “endure sound doctrine,
but according to their own desires, because they
have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;
and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and
be turned aside to fables” (verses 3-4). Friend, there is no
doubt about it. These words point toward an apostasy in
the church that will lead professed Christians to turn from
Bible truth to fictitious fables.
4. 2 Peter 2: Peter told the early believers that soon “there
will be false teachers among you” (vs. 1). “Among you”
means inside the church.
5. Jude: After urging believers to contend earnestly for the
original faith, Jude warned that “certain men” had already
“crept in unnoticed” among them (vs. 4).
6. Revelation 2: Jesus Christ Himself sadly told His followers
in the church of Ephesus, “Nevertheless, I have this
against you, that you have left your first love. Remember
therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the
first works…” (verses 4 and 5). These words are so clear!
Many Christians in the early church of Ephesus were
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
64
falling away from their initial love for Jesus Christ, who
died for them.
Thus we see Paul, Peter, Jude, and Jesus Christ all passionately concerned
about a “falling away,” which means an apostasy, occurring inside the
Christian Church. We might compare this apostasy to a disease entering a
portion of a human body. As a result, a malignant cancer finally develops.
The shocking reality is that God’s Word has predicted a similar disease-like
condition would eventually overtake a large portion of Christianity.
According to 2 Thessalonians 2, as a direct result of this unhappy condition,
a diabolical spiritual cancer would rise up.
Paul called this cancer, “the mystery of lawlessness” (2 Thessalonians 2:7).
We call him antichrist.

Judas: A Type of Antichrist
Knowledge is power.
— Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626)
Paul warned, “Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day [the
day when Jesus Christ returns to gather us] will not come unless the falling
away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition” (2
Thessalonians 2:3). Here Paul called the antichrist, “the son of perdition.”
Believe it or not, this phrase, “the son of perdition,” is actually like a
secret password to hidden knowledge. Our society is now making a full use of
passwords, passphrases, or passcodes. When you phone your bank to inquire
about your account, the receptionist usually asks, “What’s your mother’s
maiden name?” or, “What’s your social security number?” or simply, “What’s
your password?” The same thing happens on the Net when a person attempts
to access their Wells Fargo bank account, their AT&T information, or
Charles Schwab brokerage account. After typing in the correct phrase on the
keyboard, he or she can “Enter” and view the details.
The biblical phrase, “the son of perdition,” also has certain passwordlike
qualities. In essence, those four words are like a special code. Once we
understand their meaning, we are enabled to “crack the antichrist code” and
“Enter” into an understanding of the true nature of the ultimate deceiver.
This exact phrase, “the son of perdition,” occurs only twice in the entire
New Testament. One of these is in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 about the antichrist.
What about the other one, who did it apply to, and what spiritual lesson can
we learn from this? The only other time it is used is in John 17:12 when Jesus
67
Christ applied it to one of His own disciples. You should be able to guess
which one. That’s right. Judas Iscariot, His betrayer.
Judas was one of the twelve disciples. After being chosen by the Lord,
he became part of Christ’s inner circle (see Luke 6:13-16). Amazingly,
Judas even received the power of God (see Matthew 10:1-4). But in spite
of his tremendous privileges, Mr. Iscariot finally fell away from His Savior
(see Acts 1:25).
“Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered
among the twelve” (Luke 22:3). What a scary verse! Try to imagine it. Here’s
a disciple of Jesus Christ who held an honored position among the twelve.
He even carried the moneybag. But as Judas opened his heart to the dark one,
satan slipped in and took over. He was still a professed follower of Christ, but
now he had a devil inside! Could this be what antichrist will be like?
On the last night before His final agony, our Lord met with his little
band of followers in an upper room somewhere inside Jerusalem. This was
an intimate gathering, private, for only His closest friends. As they met for
the Passover meal, Judas quietly took his seat with the other eleven disciples
(see Luke 22:14). After Jesus passed out the bread and the juice, Judas
silently sipped his cup (see Luke 22:19-20). When the supper was over,
Jesus sadly whispered to his friends, “Behold, the hand of My betrayer is
with Me on the table” (Luke 22:21). Moments later, Judas slipped out into
the night to finalize his infamous deal with the rulers of Israel. An ancient
word was fulfilled, “Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate
my bread, has lifted up his heel against me” (Psalm 41:9). How terrible to
be betrayed by a friend!
A few hours later, Judas led a mob of Temple guards, chief priests, and
Roman soldiers to Christ’s secret place of prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Approaching the Savior, the traitor whispered, “Hail, Master; and kissed Him”
(Matthew 26:49 KJV). Oh, what a kiss was this! A sign of true affection? No. It
was a kiss of death. What’s really happening here? I’ll tell you. Lucifer himself
was working through the kiss of a professed Christian in a satanically orchestrated
plot against the Son of God. If you think about it, this is antichrist in its
most sinister form!
To all appearances, Judas Iscariot was a faithful apostle of Jesus Christ.
With his lips he even called Christ his Master, but his foul breath was full of
satanic venom. By this time, Judas was fully “a devil” (John 6:70). Now don’t
miss this point: He was a Christian devil, a channel for satan who was hiding
behind a Christian mask. Behold the ultimate deception! What could be worse
than satan working through a highly honored professed Christian, through
words of loyalty, through an affectionate kiss? And what highly significant
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
68
phrase did Jesus use to describe this unusual Christian-kissing-satanic combination?
Our Lord called Judas, “the son of perdition” (John 17:12).
Which is what Paul called the antichrist (see 2 Thessalonians 2:3). In so
doing, he was revealing secret, vital, inside information. As we approach our
biblical monitors and type in this passphrase, “THE SON OF PERDITION,”
the words are “Accepted” and we are enabled to “Enter” and “crack the
antichrist code” about the true nature of satan’s trickster. Instead of being an
openly anti-Christian person who rises outside the Church, the real antichrist
will be Judas-like. In other words, he will come from the inner circle. On the
surface, he will look like a true follower of Jesus Christ, a “familiar friend”
(Psalm 41:9). He will even profess love and loyalty to the Savior. Yet the
devil will be there in secret, working with ingenious subtlety, to betray the
Son of God with a kiss.

One Future Mr. Diabolical?
Appearances are often deceiving.
— Aesop (620-560 B.C.)
Paul called antichrist, “the man of sin” (2 Thessalonians 2:3). It is primarily
because of this phrase that millions have concluded that the word,
“antichrist,” must ultimately apply to only one Mr. Wicked. Kids who read
the popular Left Behind books sometimes call him, the Evil Dude.
Apocalyptic Christian films like The Omega Code, A Thief in the Night,
Tribulation, Judgment, and Megiddo, all reflect the same idea. Is it true? Will
there be only one Mr. Scary who becomes the antichrist, an Osama bin
Laden-number 2? Is this what Paul really meant?
In chapter 8 of End Time Delusions, we discovered John wrote about
“many antichrists” (1 John 2:18), and “that spirit of antichrist” (1 John 4:3
KJV). He also revealed that anyone who denies “the doctrine of Christ” (2
John 9) is “a deceiver and an antichrist” (2 John 7, emphasis added).
Therefore the idea of only one Mr. Sinister as the antichrist fails the biblical
test. Truth can afford to be fair. It has nothing to hide and is willing to examine
every iota of evidence. So what did Paul mean when he referred to “the
man of sin”? Doesn’t this mean a single person?
First of all, Paul used other phrases in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 to
describe this same antichrist, such as “the son of perdition,” (vs. 3), “the mystery
of lawlessness” (vs. 7), and “that Wicked” (vs. 8 KJV). In Daniel’s parallel
prophecy, this same abominable horror is also called a little “horn”
(Daniel 7:8); and in the Book of Revelation it is labeled “the beast”
(Revelation 13:2). Almost everyone agrees these words and phrases apply to
the same thing. The big question is: Do they all apply to only one “Evil
71
Dude,” as is commonly taught, or do they point to something wider and
deeper—to something most prophecy teachers aren’t telling us about?
Notice carefully, Daniel did not say the little horn would be a man, but
rather it would have “eyes like the eyes of a man” (Daniel 7:8, emphasis
added). Eyes of intelligence. In the Book of Revelation, the same horn is
called “the beast.” Here’s a key question: How does Daniel 7 define a beast?
There is no need to guess or to pull an interpretation out of a hat. An angelic
interpreter explained to Daniel, “…the fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom
on earth” (vs. 23). Presto! What is a beast? A man? A giant computer?
No. A beast is a kingdom! That’s what the angel said. And once again, just
like the angels in Acts 1 who watched Jesus ascend to Heaven, this angel had
his theology straight.
Let’s go back to Paul’s prophecy. A careful study of 2 Thessalonians 2
actually reveals the utter impossibility of “the man of sin” applying to only
one Mr. Diabolical. First of all, Paul said that in his own day this very same
“mystery of lawlessness [was] already at work” (vs. 7). Thus this predicted
antichrist was already becoming active in the first century. Paul was also very
emphatic that this “mystery” would continue all the way down to the second
coming of Jesus Christ (vs. 8). Put the pieces together. How could this refer
to only one human being? He would have to be 2,000 years old!
Did Paul ever use this expression, “the man,” in any of his other
writings in such a way that it does not refer to one individual? Yes
indeed. Paul wrote:
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped
for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17, emphasis added).
Look carefully. Does the phrase, “the man of God,” in 2 Timothy 3:17
refer to only one holy human who might have a name like Joe, Bill, or Frank?
No. Instead, it refers to a succession of godly men throughout history who
become “complete” or “perfect” (KJV) through obeying the Word of God.
In Romans 13:4 (KJV), Paul also used the phrase, “the minister of God,”
to refer to all civil officers throughout history whom God uses to restrain evil.
Therefore, if we let Paul’s own writings interpret themselves, his unique
phrase, “the man of sin” (2 Thessalonians 2:3), need not apply to one
supremely wicked personage. What might it apply to? In the illuminating
light of 2 Timothy 3:17 and Romans 13:4, “the man of sin,” can properly
apply to a historical succession of other men who follow tradition above the
Word of Truth.

Titanic Truths About the Temple
The most dangerous thing is illusion.
— Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
Left Behind swirls completely around the topic of the antichrist. Book
Nine of these fast-selling, fictitious novels is called Descecration—Antichrist
Takes the Throne. Released on October 30, 2001 with an initial print run of
3 million copies, the official Left Behind website then declared, “In
Desecration, Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia enters the temple in Jerusalem and
declares himself God, leading the world to the brink of Armageddon.” Thus
the eye of the storm is Jerusalem and the apex of the drama centers on
Nicolae’s abominable entrance into a rebuilt Jewish temple.
The cornerstone Bible passage underlying the theology of Desecration
and of countless other prophecy books which teach similar things is 2
Thessalonians 2:4. Describing the antichrist, Paul wrote: “…[he] opposes and
exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits
as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God” (vs. 4). Thus
antichrist will sit “in the temple of God.” Desecration applies this to someone
like Nicolae Carpathia who will enter a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem after the
rapture. The implication of this common interpretation is that Paul’s
antichrist-in-the-temple prediction has nothing to do with Christians today,
nor has it had any real relevance to the Church for almost 2,000 years. Is this
popular interpretation really what Paul had in mind? Let’s take a closer look.
It’s time for another Greek lesson. The original Greek word Paul used
in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 for “temple” is naos. Here’s a safe principle of interpretation:
Let’s allow Paul to interpret Paul. Did Paul use this same word anywhere
else in his writings? Yes. In his letter to the early Corinthians, Paul
73
wrote to “the church of God which is at Corinth” (1 Corinthians 1:2). Then
he inquired, “Do you not know that you are the temple [naos] of God and
that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16) Here Paul clearly
applied the word naos to the Christian Church—not a physical temple in
Jerusalem. He did the same thing in his letter to the Ephesians. Writing to
“the saints who are in Ephesus,” Paul said they were all growing “into a holy
temple [naos] in the Lord” (Ephesians 1:1; 2:21). In fact, in all of his writings,
every time Paul used the word naos, he always applied it to the Christian
Church and never to a rebuilt Israeli temple!
Consider this: When Jesus Christ died on Calvary, His death put an end
to all bloody animal sacrifices. When He cried out, “It is finished!” (John
19:30), that was it. From God’s cosmic perspective, all earthly sacrifices were
over because His Son was the final Sacrifice (see Hebrews 10:12). Think
about it. If the Jewish people ever do rebuild a temple in Jerusalem and restart
bloody sacrifices, this would be a complete denial of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice—
a slap in God’s face. Could such a rebuilt Jewish temple ever properly be
called by Paul, “the temple of God”? Not in a million light-years! Such a temple
would not be God’s temple, for it would be an open denial of His Son. The
correct interpretation of 2 Thessalonians 2:4, based on Paul’s own use of
naos, is that “the temple of God” is the Church. The lesson for prophecy students
is this: Antichrist, subtle and deceptive, will slither into Christianity.
Dr. Henry Grattan Guinness, D.D., F.R.A.S. (1835-1910) has often
been called “England’s Greatest Teacher of Prophecy.” Founder of the East
London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions (1872), Dr. Guinness was
considered to be one of the three greatest preachers of his day, right along
with Dwight L. Moody and Charles Haddon Spurgeon. (Guinness was sometimes
called “The Northern Spurgeon.”) A deep student of prophecy, and
especially of the antichrist topic, he commented over 100 years ago:
Observe the place occupied by the man of sin—the
“temple” or house of God. This is not, and cannot be, any
Jewish temple. Paul, who uses this expression in his prophetic
portrait…employs it both in Corinthians and Ephesians
with reference to the Christian Church…To Paul emphatically
the temple of God was the Church of Christ. This is the
temple in which his prophetic eye saw the man of sin seated.
It is no question of his bodily location in any structure of
wood and stone, but of something far higher. The temple of
God is that “spiritual house” in which He dwells. It is built
up of “living stones,” of true believers. It is here that the man
of sin was to usurp the place of God. This is the “mystery,”
the dread danger, the deadly evil, predicted by the Apostle.19

74
Edward Bishop Elliott’s (1793-1875) classic, four-volume Horae
Apocalypticae—A Commentary on the Apocalypse, was considered by
Spurgeon, in his Comments on the Commentaries, to be “The standard work
on the subject” of prophetic interpretation. In his comments on 2
Thessalonians 2:4, E.B. Elliott agreed with Guinness:
The impiety and pride of this Man of Sin were thus predicted;—
that he would be pre-eminently an opposer to
Christ and his Church;—that he would exalt himself above
all that was called God, or an object of worship, i.e. above
the gods many and lords many in the gentile heaven and
earth, including the potentates and kings of this world;—
that he would sit in God’s temple, (a phrase here meaning
the Church) and actually there exhibit himself as God.20
Thus Guinness and Elliott (I will quote them several times in this
book) both understood Paul’s use of naos to mean the professed Church of
Jesus Christ.
Paul said antichrist will “sit” in God’s temple. This doesn’t mean he
will literally sit down on a four-legged chair. After Jesus Christ ascended
to Heaven, He “sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). Has
He been sitting down for almost 2,000 years? No. When our Lord returns,
He will come “sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the
clouds of heaven” (Matthew 26:64). Will He be sitting on a fast-moving
heavenly chair? No again. To “sit” can mean to assume a position of authority.
When George W. Bush was inaugurated as President of the United
States on January 20, 2001, newspapers around the world referred to him
as being officially “seated” in office. When Jesus Christ ascended to
Heaven to sit at the right hand of the Father, this means He was officially
seated in office as King of kings and Lord of lords, the Supreme
Mediator in behalf of the human family. He now has all authority in
Heaven and on earth (see Matthew 28:18).
Then what is the meaning of the antichrist sitting in the temple of
God? A little reflection should make this clear. The shocking reality is
that prophecy predicts that the antichrist will usurp the legitimate authority
of Jesus Christ by assuming an unauthorized position of power inside the
Christian Church. And thus, contrary to the New York Times bestselling
book Desecration and countless other similar works, Paul’s prediction about
an evil antichrist entering the temple of God has great relevance for
Christians today.
Titanic Truths About the Temple

Chapter 13
The Restrainer: Myths and Memories
Zeal without knowledge is fire without light.
— Dr. Thomas Fuller (1608-1661)
In the 1800’s there supposedly lived a man named Sherlock Holmes.
His name has become famous as one of the greatest detectives of all time.
According to mystery writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mr. Holmes lived in a
small apartment on Baker Street, in London, England. A museum exists
there today to the delight of his fans. The living room, dining room, and bedroom
have been preserved, providing excellent footage for many Sherlock
Holmes films. As the story goes, Sherlock often sat in his study with his good
friend Mr. Watson, smoking his pipe, as they carefully pieced together bits of
information to solve crimes.
In this chapter we will play the role of Sherlock Holmes by attempting
to solve a most puzzling Bible mystery. The difficult question is: What is the
restrainer of antichrist? In 2 Thessalonians 2:5-8, Paul revealed the intriguing
idea that in his own day something was restraining this horrendous development
of evil. Once the restraint was removed, antichrist would be
revealed. Millions of Christians today have been taught that this restrainer is
the Holy Spirit inside the Christian Church. According to this theory, once
the Church is whisked out of this world in the rapture—along with the Holy
Spirit who dwells inside the Church—then Mr. Delusion will appear. This
interpretation once again confirms the concept in many minds that
antichrist can only come after the Church vanishes.
Sherlock Holmes is purported to have said, “It is a capital mistake to
theorize before one has data.” So, let’s examine the datum. Paul told the early
Thessalonians, “Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told
77
you these things? And now you know what is restraining, that he may be
revealed in his own time. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work;
only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way. And
then the lawless one will be revealed…” (2 Thessalonians 2:5-8).
To begin with, it must be admitted that Paul did not explicitly specify
what was restraining antichrist. Nevertheless, the following three clues
are clear:
1. Paul previously “told” the Thessalonians what the
restrainer was (vs. 5).
2. The Thessalonians knew what it was (vs. 6).
3. For some important reason, Paul did not identify the
restrainer in writing.
Sherlock Holmes is also believed to have said, “Detection is, or should
be, an exact science.” As we ponder the evidence above, a significant detail
surfaces. Because Paul plainly said he “told” the Thessalonians what the
restrainer was, this knowledge had obviously been given to the early Church.
So, as good detectives, what should we do next? It seems logical that we
should first go back into the dusty records of ancient history in an attempt to
discover what the early Church might have reported on this subject. Can’t
you just hear Mr. Holmes repeating his classic line to Watson, “It’s elementary,
my dear Watson, elementary!” Yes, it is. So let’s go back and find out.
Did the early Christians reveal what they knew about this subject? Did
they identify the restrainer? The answer, surprisingly, is yes. Such early writers as
Irenaeus, Tertullian, Chrysostom, Jerome, and Augustine all wrote about this
topic. What did they say? They all said the restrainer was the civil power of the
Roman Empire ruled by the Caesars. Notice carefully the following quotations:
Tertullian: “…he who now hinders must hinder until
he be taken out of the way. What obstacle is there but the
Roman state; the falling away of which, by being scattered
into ten kingdoms, shall introduce antichrist….”21
John Chrysostom: “…‘he who now letteth will let,
until he be taken out of the way,’ that is, when the Roman
Empire is taken out of the way, then he [antichrist] shall come;
and naturally, for as long as the fear of this empire lasts, no
one will readily exalt himself; but when that is dissolved, he
will attack the anarchy, and endeavor to seize upon the government
both of men and of God.”22
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
78
Augustine: “…it is not absurd to believe that these
words of the apostle, ‘Only he who now holdeth, let him
hold until he be taken out of the way,’ refer to the Roman
empire….”23
It’s obvious. The early Church believed the Roman Empire was the
restrainer of the antichrist. Many have recognized this fact. Elliott wrote, “We
have the consenting testimony of the early Fathers, from Irenaeus, the disciple
of St. John, down to Chrysostom and Jerome, to the effect that it [the restrainer]
was understood to be the imperial power ruling and residing at Rome.”24 Dr.
George Eldon Ladd, a much-respected Baptist professor at Fuller Theological
Seminary in the 1950’s, also confirmed, “The traditional view has been that
the restraining principle is the Roman Empire and the restrainer the Emperor.
This view, or a modification of it, best fits into the Pauline theology.”25
Guinness also summarized:
The early Church, through the writings of the Fathers,
tells us what it knew upon the subject, and with remarkable
unanimity affirms that this “let,” or hindrance, was the
Roman empire as governed by the Caesars; that while the
Caesars held imperial power, it was impossible for the predicted
antichrist to arise, and that on the fall of the Caesars
he would arise…The early Church tells us what it did know
upon the subject, and no one in these days can be in a position
to contradict its testimony as to what Paul had, by word
of mouth, told the Thessalonians. It is a point on which
ancient tradition alone can have any authority. Modern
speculation is positively impertinent on such a subject.26
When modern interpreters identify the restrainer as the Holy Spirit
inside the Christian Church, they are simply expressing a newly developed
fancy unsupported by historical evidence. Mr. Holmes said, “Detection is, or
should be, an exact science.” It’s simply not historically scientific to identify
the restrainer as the Holy Ghost within the Church. Unfortunately, this new
theory has now become one of the supporting pillars beneath the idea that
the rapture must come before antichrist shows up. But we have already
proven from 2 Thessalonians 2 that it’s really the other way around. Paul
emphatically said antichrist must come first (vs. 3) before the Church is gathered
to Jesus Christ (vs. 1).
In addition to being directly “told” by Paul that the restrainer of the
antichrist was the Roman Empire, another reason why the early Church
believed this may be found in the parallel prophecy of Daniel 7. Daniel’s
prophecy predicted the rise of four great beasts representing four successive
world empires (see Daniel 7:23). The vast majority of commentators
The Restrainer: Myths and Memories
79
throughout church history—including Guinness and Elliott—have identified
these four empires as the successive kingdoms of Babylon, Medo-Persia,
Greece, and Rome.
Martin Luther commented:
This prophecy of Daniel [7] is by all teachers uniformly
explained to represent the kingdoms of Assyria and
Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, the kingdom of Alexander
the Great, and the fourth, the Roman empire, which is the
largest, the most cruel, and most powerful….27
In Daniel 7, the fourth beast, or Roman Empire, is described as having
“ten horns” (vs. 7). Most scholars apply these ten horns to ten kingdoms to
arise in Western Europe after the demise of the Roman Empire. Daniel’s
prophecy distinctly says that “after” the ten horns are in place, and then rising
up “among them,” would come “another little horn” with “eyes like the
eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things” (vs. 8 KJV). The vast
majority of scholars, even today, regardless of how they apply the symbolism,
correctly associate the little horn with the antichrist. The lesson is clear:
After the fourth beast, that is, after the fall of Rome, the antichrist would rise
up among ten nations in Europe.
The Thessalonians lived under the rule of Rome. Through understanding
the prophecies, they knew that after Rome fell, the antichrist would
come. This helps explain why the early Christians (according to Tertullian)
made it a habit to pray for the continuation of that very empire, even though
it was cruelly persecuting them (see 2 Thessalonians 1:4) for their trust in
Jesus Christ. Wait a minute! Here’s another important piece of data! The
reality of this fierce Roman persecution against the early Christians provides
a logical explanation as to why Paul only “told” the Thessalonians what the
restrainer was, rather than writing it down. What if his letter fell into the
hands of unfriendly Roman officials? What if Roman leaders found out that
these Christians expected the mighty Roman Empire to someday crash, being
“taken out of the way”? The answer is obvious. They would have seen this as
high treason against Caesar and would have increased their persecution
against the infant Church. This explains why, instead of writing it down,
Paul merely “told” the truth to the Thessalonians. Can’t you see Sherlock’s
piercing eyes as he gathers information while smoking his pipe? “This is key
data,” he would surely whisper to Watson.
Paul wrote: “For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, only he
who now restrains will do so, until he is taken out of the way” (2
Thessalonians 2:7). Thus the antichrist was “already” starting to work in
Paul’s time, yet it was restrained by the mighty power of the Roman Empire.
Once this restraint was removed by the collapse of the Roman government,
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
80
this monstrous evil would fully rise in Europe. In other words, once the
Caesars went down, antichrist would fully raise its satanic head.
Here’s a simple summary of the biblical data found in 2 Thessalonians 2:
1. The antichrist was already starting to work in Paul’s
day (vs. 7).
2. Something was restraining this horrible development of
evil (verses 5-7).
3. As soon as the restraint was removed, antichrist would be
revealed (verses 7-8).
4. This antichrist will continue until the visible return of
Jesus Christ (vs. 8).
5. Then Christ will destroy the antichrist and gather His
Church (verses 1,8).
Daniel wrote that after the fourth beast fell, the little horn would come
(see Daniel 7:7-8). Paul said that after the restrainer was taken out of the way,
the antichrist would be revealed (see 2 Thessalonians 2:7-8). History records
that the Roman Empire collapsed in 476 A.D. Did the predicted antichrist
soon appear? Read on.
Sherlock Holmes would say, “It’s elementary, Mr. Watson, elementary.”

Putting the Pieces Together
What we see depends mainly on what we look for.
— Sir John Lubbock (1834-1913)
When I was a boy, I loved super-complicated jigsaw puzzles. For hours I
would sit, ponder, and carefully fit the pieces into the spaces. As you can
imagine, it was always exciting for me to see the last few puzzle pieces snap
into place. “Mom, I did it again!” I would happily shout as the full image of
a house, car, or mountain lake took shape. She would smile approvingly.
The Bible’s prophecies about the antichrist are similar to a gigantic jigsaw
puzzle. While it’s important to carefully examine the individual pieces,
it’s really best to put them all together and look at the whole thing. When
we do, just like a developing photograph in a darkroom, the emerging picture
becomes clearer and clearer. This is what we find.
PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER FROM DANIEL 7
1. Daniel dreamed of four great beasts representing four successive
ancient world kingdoms (verses 4-7,23).
2. These kingdoms were the nations of Babylon, Persia,
Greece, and Rome.
3. The fourth beast, the Roman Empire, had ten horns
(vs. 7), representing the division of the Western
Roman Empire into ten smaller nations after 476 A.D.
(the classical date for the fall of Rome).
83
4. Growing up “among” the ten horns (vs. 8), and rising up
immediately “after” them (vs. 24), would be a little horn
(vs. 8) which represents the antichrist.
5. This little horn would have “eyes like the eyes of a man”
(vs. 8), “a mouth speaking pompous words” (vs. 8), and
would make “war against the saints” (vs. 21) in Christian
history. This horn would continue until the end of time
(verses 21-22).
PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER FROM 2 THESSALONIANS 2
1. The antichrist would rise as a result of a tremendous falling
away (vs. 3) in the Church before Jesus Christ returns to
gather the faithful (vs. 1).
2. Paul called this antichrist, “the man of sin” (vs. 3), “the
son of perdition” (vs. 3), “the mystery of lawlessness”
(vs. 7), and “that Wicked” (vs. 8 KJV).
3. This “mystery of lawlessness” was already working in Paul’s
day (vs. 7), yet it was being restrained (verses 5-7) by the
Caesars of the Roman Empire.
4. After this restraint was removed (Rome fell in 476 A.D.),
the antichrist would be revealed (verses 7-8).
5. This antichrist would take his seat inside “the temple of
God” (vs. 4), which is the Church (see 1 Corinthians
3:16; Ephesians 2:21).
6. He will operate until the bright, visible, glorious return of
our Lord (vs. 8).
7. When Jesus Christ comes, He will destroy the antichrist
and gather His faithful people who have not “fallen away”
from the truth of His Word (verses 1,3,8,10-12).
PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER FROM REVELATION 13
1. The antichrist is also called “the beast” (vs. 2).
2. This “beast” is the same thing as the “little horn” in
Daniel 7.
3. Just like the little horn, this beast would have “a mouth
speaking great things” (vs. 5) and would “make war with
the saints” (vs. 7).
4. A beast in prophecy represents a powerful “kingdom on
earth” (see Daniel 7:23).
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
84
5. This beast will eventually have worldwide influence and
control (vs. 8).
6. This beast will continue until the end of time (see
Revelation 19:20).
The Bible reveals a few more pieces to this antichrist jigsaw puzzle, but
this is enough for now. So what are we looking for when it comes to the real
antichrist of prophecy?
In a nutshell, we are looking for an antichrist that was starting to work
in the time of Paul, but was being restrained by the Roman Empire. It would
grow in strength in the wake of a massive “falling away” from Jesus inside the
Christian Church and would be “revealed” unrestrained after the Roman
Empire fell in 476 A.D. It would be centered somewhere in Western Europe,
would become self-exalting, and would even usurp the authority of God
inside His temple—that is, within Christianity. An actual “kingdom,” it
would nevertheless have “eyes like the eyes of a man” (being man-led and
man-centered), make large claims for itself, have “a mouth speaking great
things,” become persecuting and deadly, making “war against the saints.” It
would continue throughout Christian history and achieve global influence in
the end times, yet finally be destroyed by the sin-consuming brightness of our
Lord Jesus Christ when He returns.
Those are the facts from Scripture. Is such an antichrist here now? You
are about to discover irrefutable proof that for over four hundred years the
unanimous testimony of well-respected Protestant scholars, historians, and
burnt-to-ashes martyrs has been, “Most definitely!”

Echoes of Forgotten Voices
Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen.
— Martin Luther (1483-1546)
Speech at the Diet of Worms, April 18, 1521
The New Testament Church possessed an all-consuming desire to exalt
Jesus Christ and His incomprehensible once-and-for-all Sacrifice for the sins
of the whole world (see Hebrews 10:12; 1 John 2:2). The Book of Acts
reports, CNN-style, how the message of Christ’s perfect righteousness and
grace spread like an uncontrollable brushfire throughout the Roman Empire
(see Acts 2:36-41; 5:14; 8:4). As the apostles lifted up the Risen One before
the multitudes, sinners realized they were loved by God in spite of their
faults, and the Lord’s power moved them to repent, be baptized, and stop
serving satan (see Acts 2:38; 26:18). As people trusted the merits of Jesus
Christ for salvation (see Acts 16:31), rather than their own “works” (see
Ephesians 2:9), He forgave their sins (see Acts 13:38), purified their hearts
(see Acts 15:8-9), and set their feet on the path to Paradise.
As a result of Spirit-filled preaching, strong churches were raised up in
the midst of an idol-worshiping, pleasure-crazy, Caesar-devoted world. The
new Christian converts were taught to obey the Bible above the traditions of
men (see Colossians 2:8) and to cherish “every word that proceeds from the
mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). They had discovered the only way to the
Father, Jesus Christ Himself (see John 14:6); and were taught to trust Him
implicitly (see Ephesians 1:12) as the only Mediator between Almighty God
and the human family (see 1 Timothy 2:5). They were also taught the importance
of “obeying the truth” (1 Peter 1:22, emphasis added), even if it meant
opposition, ridicule, or death. They were willing to walk the narrow road
87
“which leads to life” (Matthew 7:14) because Jesus was precious to them, just
as they were to Him.
But as the Christian train rolled down history’s track, monumental
changes took place. Just as Paul predicted, there came a tremendous “falling
away” (2 Thessalonians 2:3) from the simplicity and purity of the gospel.
Almost imperceptibly, false theories, man-made traditions, and unbiblical
practices slipped into the very heart of Christianity. Little by little people lost
sight of the beauty and loveliness of Jesus. In the fourth century, during the
time of Constantine, a large portion of the church compromised key Bible
truths and decided to line up with the Roman State. Rejecting the humility
of the meek and lowly One (see Matthew 11:29), church leaders sought
pomp and worldly glory. Leaving the heavenly “power of the Holy Spirit”
(Romans 15:13), they relied on the earthly power of politics and government.
As even more traditions came in, Europe eventually became engulfed
in the Dark Ages. In the twelfth century, a monstrous tribunal was established
called the “Holy Office of the Inquisition” which was purposefully
“created to persecute and exterminate ‘heresy’ by violence and not by persuasion.”
28 Its 600-year history is filled with “gloomy portals,” “dark passages,”
“locked doors,” “dungeons,” “bloodstained records,” and “extreme,
merciless, unmitigated tortures.”29 Incredibly, so-called Christians murdered
other Christians in “the name of Jesus Christ.”30
By the time the 1500’s came along, the original simplicity of the early
Christian faith was virtually nonexistent. All over Europe sinners were
taught to confess their sins to priests, to pray to the Virgin Mary, to buy
“forgiveness notes” called indulgences, and to kiss statues of the saints,
none of which is taught in the New Testament. Monks even beat themselves
with whips in a misguided effort to earn the favor of God. It’s true,
there were sincere and godly people in what had become the Roman
Catholic Church, but overall, Christianity was a mess! In pity Jesus Christ
must have looked down from His throne and told His angels, “It’s time for
the Protestant Reformation!”
21st century Christians should realize it was sincere Catholics wanting a
change that originally spearheaded the Reformation. Initially, they had no
thought of leaving the Mother Church but simply wanted to redirect their
Catholic countrymen away from the traditions of men and to lead them back
to the pure truths of the Word. Their main goal was to lead other sinners like
themselves to stop trusting their own works for salvation and to have simple
faith in Jesus Christ. The Bible says, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
you will be saved” (Acts 16:31). “By grace you have been saved through faith,
and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone
should boast” (Ephesians 2:8, 9). “Therefore, having been justified by faith,
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1).
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
88
Salvation is a wonderful gift from Jesus (see Romans 6:23). When we
repent of our sins and receive this gift, trusting alone in Christ, the Father
Himself forgives us, transforms our hearts by the Holy Spirit, and gives us
power to obey His Word (see Luke 13:3; 1 John 1:9; 1 Peter 1:22; John
17:17). This simple message of free salvation through what Jesus Christ has
already done for the entire world on the cross, and of “the power of His resurrection”
(Philippians 3:10), is called the good news of the gospel. Paul
defined the good news as: “Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day
according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). We must believe this
good news wholeheartedly, for it alone can save our souls (see 1 Peter 1:3,9).
The word antichrist literally means “opposed to” or “in the place of”
Christ,31 and in its most subtle and diabolical manifestation it concerns something
which claims loyalty to Jesus while really leading away from Him. Now
let’s take a closer look at what truly happened during the time of the
Protestant Reformation.
In the 1500’s, as a result of the invention of the printing press, countless
European and English Catholics read the Bible for the first time in their
lives. As a result, they uncovered the good news of salvation through trusting
in Christ. At the same time, to their shock and amazement, they also
realized that many Romish doctrines—including praying to dead saints and
confessing to priests—actually led away from a simple faith in the merits of
the Lamb. Compelled by the Spirit, these sincere Catholics tried to reform
the church they loved from within. They preached the gospel and even
appealed to the Pope. The result was fury, intense opposition, threats of
flames, and the ugly cry, “You’re now a candidate for the Inquisition!” As the
conflict deepened, those who saw the Bible as their final authority began to
have serious doubts about the basic authority of a church that utilized torture
chambers. In other words, they began to question whether the Holy
Apostolic Roman Catholic Church, as an institution centered in popes and
the Vatican, was really the Bride of Jesus Christ in the first place.
One by one the reformers turned to the prophecies. In amazement they
discovered what Paul actually wrote about “the falling away,” “the son of
perdition,” and a “mystery of lawlessness” that would proudly set itself up
inside “the temple of God,” which is the church (see 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4,7;
1 Corinthians 3:16). They were stunned to read Daniel’s prophecy about a
“little horn” with “eyes like the eyes of a man,” “a mouth speaking great
things,” that would be centered in Western Europe and would make bloody
“war against the saints” (Daniel 7:7-8,21). They shuddered as they realized
this same power was called “the beast” in God’s last book, and that it would
finally exert worldwide influence and control (see Revelation 13:2,7-8).
They were especially jolted when they read about a harlot named “Mystery
Echoes of Forgotten Voices
89
Babylon” who was “drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of
the martyrs of Jesus” (Revelation 17:6). As death sentence after death sentence
was hurled against them for pointing sinners to the holy Lamb of God,
and as the smoke of burning martyrs blackened Europe’s fair skies, these
reformers eventually came to a frightening, unanimous, and terribly solemn
conclusion. They had discovered Jesus Christ and antichrist.
Let me clarify something right here. Even though, in the pages that follow,
I will apply the Bible’s prophecies about the “little horn” and “the beast”
to the papal system in general (because of its doctrines and practices), this
does not reflect a judgment on individual Catholics. Personally, I have nothing
against any member of the Roman Church. Because God is merciful and
judges men fairly based on the light they have (see James 4:17), I know I will
meet many sincere Catholics in Christ’s Kingdom.
Nor does my position reflect an exclusive view of the word antichrist itself.
I realize “the spirit of antichrist” is now working inside various organizations
and non-Christian religions, including many churches that call themselves
Protestant. Nothing written here is designed to promote hostility toward any
human being. Jesus said “God so loved the world” (John 3:16) which includes
the Pope; and His clear command to “love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew
22:39) applies to Protestants, Catholics, Muslims, Hindus, and everyone else.
Yet this book is about the prophetic truths of God’s Word, truths which must not
be ignored by any God-fearing, Bible-believing Christian.
The following quotations may seem a bit strong for our politically
correct modern ears, but they reveal the facts of history. The reader is
encouraged to consider them squarely and honestly, in the blazing light of
Bible prophecy.
MARTIN LUTHER (1483-1546) (LUTHERAN):
Newsweek reported, “Martin Luther was the first to
identify the papacy as such with the Antichrist. At first he
discounted the value of John’s Apocalypse. But then he saw
in it a revelation of the Church of Rome as the deceiving
Antichrist…a view that was to become dogma for all
Protestant Churches.”32
“Luther…proved, by the revelations of Daniel and St.
John, by the epistles of St. Paul, St. Peter, and St. Jude, that
the reign of Antichrist, predicted and described in the Bible,
was the Papacy.”33

On August 20, 1520, Luther declared, “We here are of
the conviction that the papacy is the seat of the true and real
Antichrist.”34
JOHN CALVIN (1509-1564) (PRESBYTERIAN):
“Some persons think us too severe and censorious
when we call the Roman pontiff Antichrist. But those who
are of this opinion do not consider that they bring the
same charge of presumption against Paul himself, after
whom we speak and whose language we adopt…I shall
briefly show that (Paul’s words in II Thess. 2) are not
capable of any other interpretation than that which
applies them to the Papacy.”35
JOHN KNOX (1505-1572) (SCOTCH PRESBYTERIAN):
John Knox wrote about “that tyranny which the pope
himself has for so many ages exercised over the church.”
Along with Martin Luther and John Calvin, Knox finally
concluded that the Papacy was “the very antichrist, and son
of perdition, of whom Paul speaks.”36
THOMAS CRANMER (1489-1556) (ANGLICAN):
“Whereof it followeth Rome to be the seat of
antichrist, and the pope to be very antichrist himself. I could
prove the same by many other scriptures, old writers, and
strong reasons.”37
FOX?S BOOK OF MARTYRS (1563):
Written by Englishman John Fox (1517–1587), this
much-respected volume helped “mold the national character”
of 17th-century America. Fox reported: “Disregarding
the maxims and the spirit of the Gospel, the papal Church,
arming herself with the power of the sword, vexed the
Church of God and wasted it for centuries, a period most
appropriately termed in history, the ‘dark ages.’ The kings of
the earth, gave their power to the Beast.”38
ROGERWILLIAMS (1603-1683)
(CONSIDERED THE FIRST BAPTIST PASTOR IN AMERICA):
Roger Williams spoke of the Pope as “the pretended
Vicar of Christ on earth, who sits as God over the Temple
of God, exalting himself not only above all that is called
God, but over the souls and consciences of all his vassals,
Echoes of Forgotten Voices
91
yea over the Spirit of Christ, over the Holy Spirit, yea,
and God himself…speaking against the God of heaven,
thinking to change times and laws; but he is the son of
perdition (II Thess. 2).”39
THE WESTMINSTER CONFESSION OF FAITH (1647):
“There is no other head of the church but the Lord Jesus
Christ. Nor can the pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof;
but is that Antichrist, that man of sin and son of perdition
that exalteth himself in the church against Christ and all that
is called God.”40
COTTON MATHER (1663-1728) (CONGREGATIONAL):
“The oracles of God foretold the rising of an
Antichrist in the Christian Church: and in the Pope of
Rome all the characteristics of that Antichrist are so
marvelously answered that if any who read the
Scriptures do not see it, there is a marvelous blindness
upon them.”41
JOHN WESLEY (1703-1791) (METHODIST):
Speaking of the papacy, John Wesley wrote, “He is in
an emphatic sense, the Man of Sin, as he increases all
manner of sin above measure. And he is, too, properly
styled the Son of Perdition, as he has caused the death of
numberless multitudes, both of his opposers and followers…
He it is…that exalteth himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshipped…claiming the highest power,
and highest honor…claiming the prerogatives which
belong to God alone.”42
DAVID BENEDICT?S GENERAL HISTORY OF THE BAPTIST
DENOMINATION (1813):
“…in the eleventh century, the Man of Sin appeared
to have attained the summit of arrogance and blasphemy in
the person of Gregory VII…He assumed not only the appellation
of Universal Bishop, but also those of Sovereign
Pontiff, Christ’s Vicar, Prince of the Apostles, God on earth,
Lord God the Pope, His Holiness, King of Kings and Lord of
Lords, Prince over all nations and kingdoms, The Most
Holy and Most Blessed, Master of the Universal World,
Father of Kings, Light of the World, Most High and
Sovereign Bishop, etc. etc.”43

A GREAT CLOUD OF WITNESSES :
“Wycliffe, Tyndale, Luther, Calvin, Cranmer; in the
seventeenth century, Bunyan, the translators of the King
James Bible and the men who published the Westminster
and Baptist confessions of Faith; Sir Isaac Newton, Wesley,
Whitfield, Jonathan Edwards; and more recently Spurgeon,
Bishop J.C. Ryle and Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones; these men
among countless others, all saw the office of the Papacy as
the antichrist.”44
These quotes come from some of the most respected and influential
Christians who have ever lived. They were intensely earnest, honest men
who based their conclusions on the prophecies of the Bible. I realize times
have changed. It’s true, we’re not in the Dark Ages anymore; and yes, this is
the 21st century. But there is something we must consider: Daniel’s prophecy
about “a little horn” that would make “war against the saints” (Daniel
7:8,21), Paul’s predictions about a “falling away” and an antichrist “man of
sin” or “mystery of lawlessness” that would sit in God’s temple (2
Thessalonians 2:3-4), John’s prophecy about “a beast” with global influence
(Revelation 13:2,7), and finally, Revelation’s strikingly graphic portrayal of a
woman named “Mystery Babylon” who would become drunk with “the blood
of the martyrs of Jesus” (Revelation 17:6)—these prophecies are still in the
Bible. And there is something else we should remember. Nations rise and fall,
history rushes on, technology advances, and a new millennium has arrived—
but God’s Word has not changed!
Either those dead Protestants were dead wrong, or history’s forgotten
voices still speak.

Chapter 16
1260 Years: The Time Factor
All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered;
the point is to discover them.
— Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)
“What time is it?” How many times have we heard that? The clock relentlessly
governs this high-tech world of ours. Cell phones, computers, palm pilots,
fax machines, and nightstand radios all have clocks in them. Clocks tell us when
to get out of bed, when to leave for work, when it’s time for lunch, and when to
say, “Good night.” In other words, we live our lives and make decisions based on
time. This may surprise you, but even the Creator of the universe is concerned
about time. His Book says, “When the fullness of the time had come, God sent
forth His Son” (Galatians 4:4, emphasis added). In fact, the entire life of Jesus
Christ was based on time. He knew when “His hour had come” (John 13:1) and
when it was time for His holy heart to experience the horror of sin upon the
cross. Just as Christ’s life and death was based on time, the same is true of
antichrist. Paul predicted that antichrist would “be revealed in his own time” (2
Thessalonians 2:6, emphasis added). What is the time of the antichrist?
Daniel described the antichrist as a little horn “making war against the
saints, and prevailing against them” (Daniel 7:8,21). A few sentences later he
wrote, “the saints shall be given into his hand for a time and times and half a
time” (vs. 25). This is the time of the antichrist. This special time period is actually
referred to seven times in God’s Word, being spoken of as 3 1/2 times (see Daniel
7:25; 12:7; Revelation 12:14), 42 months (see Revelation 11:2; 13:5), and 1,260
days (Revelation 11:3; 12:6). Most scholars recognize that a “time” represents a
year (the Hebrew 360-day year), and thus 3 1/2 times is 3 1/2 years, or 42 months
(based on a 30-day month), or 1,260 days. It’s simple mathematics.
95
Is this a literal time period, or a symbolic one? Consider this. Just as Daniel
7 reveals the time of the antichrist (see Daniel 7:25), even so does Daniel 9
reveal the time of Jesus Christ (see Daniel 9:24-26). That latter prophecy pinpoints
“seventy weeks,” or 490 days. As Chapter 4 of this book pointed out,
almost all Bible scholars interpret this 490-day period according to the dayfor-
a-year principle found in Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34. Thus the 490 days
are 490 literal years. We know the prophecy in Daniel 9 is a day-for-a-year
because it begins with a command to rebuild Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity
(see Daniel 9:25) and reaches all the way down to the first coming of Jesus
Christ (see Daniel 9:26). Because 490 literal days would not reach far enough to
the time of Jesus since that would only be about 1 year and 4.3 months, the
prophecy must be a day-for-a-year. That’s proof positive. Few question this.
Prophecy teachers in our generation definitely apply the day-for-a-year
principle to the famous 70th week of Daniel 9:27, which says, “And he shall
confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week
he shall cause the sacrifice…to cease” (Daniel 9:27, KJV). Based on the dayyear
truth, this “one week” is really seven years. Almost everyone agrees with
this. Yet as we have already seen, many prophecy scholars today—following
the lead of J.N. Darby—have decided to sever this 70th week from the first
69 weeks (creating an almost 2,000 year gap or parenthesis), slide it down to
the end times, and call it “the seven years of tribulation.” We have already
analyzed the problems with this view and have proven it was really Jesus
Christ who brought an end to the Jewish sacrificial system through His death
on the cross. Net conclusion: no seven-year tribulation.
Here’s a startling mega-point. Protestant scholars from the 1500’s to the
1800’s not only applied the day-for-a-year principle to the prophecy of Daniel
9:24-27 (the time of Jesus Christ), but also to the 3 1/2 years of Daniel 7:25,
to the time of antichrist. And they applied it to papal Rome. They interpreted
the 3 1/2 years, 42 months, or 1,260 days as 1,260 literal years of papal rule.
This is easy to prove, as a little study in church history will quickly
demonstrate. Dr. H. Grattan Guinness reported:
The seventy weeks of Daniel, or 490 days to the Messiah,
were fulfilled as 490 years; that is, they were fulfilled on the
year-day scale. On this scale the forty-two months, or 1,260
days, are 1,260 years. We ask then, Has the Papacy endured
this period? An examination of the facts of history will show
that it has.45
In 1701, Robert Fleming published his book, The Rise and fall
of Papal Rome.
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
96
Fleming showed, as others had done for many centuries, that
the 1,260 days of prophecy represent 1,260 years.46
E.B. Elliott, in his 1862 classic, Horae Apocalypticae, often
referred to:
…the great prophetic period of the 1260 years.47
David Benedict’s A General History of the Baptist
Denomination also commented on:
…the rise of Antichrist…his reign…[for] 1260 years.48
Such quotations could be multiplied, but this is enough to prove that
Protestant commentators of the past did not apply the 1,260-day period to a
supposedly future 7-year tribulation like modern pre-trib rapture teachers
often do. Instead, they applied it to real history—to the long period of papal
supremacy spanning the Dark Ages.
When did the 1,260 years begin? In 2 Thessalonians 2, Paul gave a clear
clue. In verse 6, he made a definite connection between the removal of the
restrainer and the beginning of the time of the antichrist. Notice carefully.
Paul told the early Thessalonians, “And now you know what is restraining,
that he [antichrist] may be revealed in his own time” (2 Thessalonians 2:6,
emphasis added). As we have previously proven, this restrainer was the fourth
beast of Daniel 7, which was the Roman Empire. In 476 A.D., when Rome
fell, the Caesar restrainer was “taken out of the way” (2 Thessalonians 2:7).
Thus we should expect the 1260-year period to begin shortly after 476 A.D.
H. Grattan Guinness places the beginning of the 1,260-year period shortly
after 476 A.D. He states that it began with “the notable decree of the emperor
Justinian [525-565 A.D.] constituting the Bishop of Rome as the head of all
Churches [in Western Europe].”49 When the Roman Empire collapsed in 476
A.D., there were still rulers in the East. One of them, named Justinian, believed
the key to peace in Europe was the uniting of all religions under the leadership
of the Roman Church. So he issued his famous decree which made the Pope
the legal “Head of all the Holy Churches.” This decree fully established the
papacy’s political power over all of Christianity in Western Europe. Justinian’s
decree went into effect in 538 A.D.,50 which was shortly after 476 A.D.! That
key date—538 A.D.—marks the beginning of the time of the antichrist.
Daniel predicted that during the 1,260-year period the little horn would
“persecute the saints of the Most High” (Daniel 7:25)—a prophecy that was
fulfilled to the letter by papal Rome during the Dark Ages. By the end of this
period, enough was enough, and Europe was ready for a change. If we start at
538 A.D. and count down 1,260 years, this takes us to 1798 A.D., the time of
the French Revolution. In the midst of a bloody reaction against the Roman
1260 Years: The Time Factor
97
Church and its monstrous torture chambers, Napoleon finally decided to abolish
the papal government entirely. Can you guess what year this feat was accomplished?
1798! That’s why Guinness marks the conclusion of the 1,260 years at
the time of “the tremendous Papal overthrow in the French Revolution.”51
In 1798, a general of Napoleon named Berthier entered Rome with a
French army. He swiftly abolished the papacy, dismissed the Vatican’s Swiss
guards, and proclaimed Rome to be a republic for France. “Berthier entered
Rome on the 10th of February, 1798, and proclaimed a republic.”52 “One day
the Pope was sitting on his throne in a chapel of the Vatican, surrounded by
his cardinals…Very soon a band of soldiers burst into the hall, who tore away
from his finger his pontifical ring, and hurried him off, a prisoner.”53 Pope Pius
VI was taken to France where he died in exile. “Napoleon gave orders that
in the event of his death no successor should be elected to his office, and that
the Papacy should be discontinued.”54
The Papacy was extinct: not a vestige of existence
remained; and among all the Roman Catholic powers not a
finger was stirred in its defense. The Eternal City had no
longer prince or pontiff; its bishop was dying captive in foreign
lands; and the decree was already announced that no
successor would be allowed in his place.55
This happened in the exact year 1798, marking the end of the predicted
1,260-year reign of the persecuting “little horn.” In that very year Protestant
scholars all over Europe and America recognized the fulfillment of the prophecy.
In the downfall of the papal government…many saw in
these events the accomplishment of prophecies, and the
exhibition of signs promised in the most mystical parts of the
Holy Scriptures.56
Is not the Papal power, at Rome, which was once so terrible,
and so domineering, at an end? But let us pause a little.
Was not this End, in other parts of the Holy Prophecies, foretold
to be, at the END of 1260 years?—And was it not foretold
by Daniel, to be at the END of a time, times, and half a time?
Which computation amounts to the same period. And now let
us see; hear; and understand. THIS IS THE YEAR 1798.57
Is it not extremely remarkable, and a powerful confirmation
of the truth of Scripture prophecy, that just 1260 years ago
from the present 1798, in the very beginning of the year 538,
Belisarius put an end to the empire of the Goths at Rome, leaving
no power therein but the Bishop of the Metropolis? Read
these things in the prophetic Scriptures; compare them coolly
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
98
with the present state of Europe, and then, I say again, deny
the truth of Divine Revelation, if you can. Open your eyes, and
behold these things accomplishing in the face of the whole
world. This thing is not done in a corner.58
Thus many scholars of the past have applied the 31/2-year, 42-month,
1,260-day prediction found in Daniel and Revelation to a 1,260-year period
starting in 538 A.D. and ending in 1798. These well-respected theologians
saw those dates—538 and 1798—as prophetic milestones, and they appealed
to the whole world to take note that God’s “sure word of prophecy” (2 Peter
1:19 KJV) had not been fulfilled in a corner.
Here is a quick summary of biblical and historical facts surrounding “the
time” of the antichrist:
1. Paul clearly wrote that after the restrainer was
removed, the antichrist would be “revealed in his own
time” (2 Thessalonians 2:6).
2. Daniel predicted that after the fourth beast fell, the “little
horn” (the antichrist) would rule for 1,260 years, “making
war against the saints” (Daniel 7:7-8,21,25).
3. Shortly after the Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476
A.D., the Eastern Emperor Justinian issued his famous
decree giving the Roman Church special power in Europe.
4. Justinian’s decree went into effect in 538 A.D., marking the
beginning of 1,260 years of European papal supremacy.
5. During the 1,260 years, the Roman Church did indeed
“make war against the saints” by papal crusades against
heretics and through the nightmarish barbarism of inhuman
inquisitors who set up their deadly tribunals in
Europe, England, India, South America, and even
Mexico. Literally millions of “saints” lost their lives.
6. In 1798 A.D, exactly 1,260 years from 538 A.D, Napoleon’s
general (Berthier) abolished the papacy’s political power,
thus ending that long and painful period of papal rule.
So what time is it? If you check your watch, computer, or cell phone you
can discover the exact minute in the Pacific, Mountain, Central or Eastern
Time zones.
But only the Bible reveals the precise time of Jesus Christ (490 years)
and antichrist (1,260 years).

Chapter 17
The Return of the Wounded Beast
The truly educated man is that rare individual who can
separate reality from illusion.
— Author Unknown
The Bible warns about the beast, “…his deadly wound was healed: and
all the world wondered after the beast” (Revelation 13:3 KJV).
Near the end of The Indwelling—The Beast Takes Possession, Book Seven
of the Left Behind novels, Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia is assassinated in
Jerusalem. His corpse is jetted to New Babylon and a funeral service takes
place before millions of viewers with full media coverage. As the world’s TV
cameras are fixed on the coffin, the unbelievable occurs. Carpathia’s left
index finger moves; his chest starts to swell; his eyes open. Nicolae finally
stands up and triumphantly declares before an awestruck world, “Peace be
unto you!”59 In Left Behind’s next book, The Mark—The Beast Rules The
World, “His Excellency Global Community Potentate Nicolae Carpathia is
back, this time as Satan. Resurrected and indwelt by the devil himself, it’s no
more Mr. Nice Guy as the beast tightens his grip as ruler of the world.”60
This is how many Christians imagine Revelation 13:3 might be
fulfilled.
This literal view of a murdered and resurrected Mr. Sin has been depicted
in scores of prophecy books and was graphically illustrated in the multimillion-
dollar Christian film, The Omega Code. Although details vary, most
modern portrayals involve the antichrist being shot with a gun and then
miraculously being raised to life. When Ronald Reagan survived a gunshot
101
wound during his presidency, some speculated that he might be the antichrist
whose deadly wound was healed!
As always, there’s a big difference between fact and fiction. The wounding
of the beast is referred to four times in Revelation (13:3,10,12,14). Yet
notice, the beast “was wounded by the sword and lived” (13:14, emphasis
added). Thus his wound comes from “the sword,” not a pistol, rifle, or submachine
gun. Revelation 13:10 also reveals the additional insight that the
wounding of the beast involves his going “into captivity.”
Paul declared “the sword of the Spirit” to be the Word of God itself
(Ephesians 6:17). During Reformation times, it was this that “wounded” the
papacy. As John Wycliffe, John Huss, William Tyndale, Martin Luther, Philip
Melanchthon, John Calvin, John Wesley, and countless other Spirit-filled
reformers wielded the Bible’s message about Jesus Christ and antichrist, papal
Rome received a nearly fatal slash. Hundreds of thousands left the Roman
Church and Europe was shaken as with a mighty earthquake. The final blow
against the weakened Roman system came in 1798 when the army of
Napoleon invaded the Vatican and took the Pope into exile.
God’s prophetic clock had set the year 1798 as the end
of the papal supremacy, and when the hour struck, the
mighty ruler on the Tiber, before whose anathemas the kings
and emperors of Europe had so long trembled, went “into
captivity” (Revelation 13:10), and his government in the
Papal States was abolished.61
You’ve heard the expression, “You’ve come a long way, baby.” This is
especially true when it comes to prophetic interpretation. Bestselling
books and blockbuster Christian movies now apply Revelation’s prophecy
about a beast that receives a deadly wound to some fictitious Mr.
Deception like Nicolae Carpathia who is assassinated after a secret rapture.
This is all like a house of illusion at an amusement park. The truth
is, the Bible says the beast, which represents a “kingdom” (Daniel 7:23),
would be “wounded by the sword” (Revelation 13:14, emphasis added) and
go “into captivity” (Revelation 13:10). The Reformation did wound the
papal power with Heaven’s razor-sharp “sword of the Spirit” (Ephesians
6:17) and finally, Rome’s leader went “into captivity” into France. This
papal downfall took place on February 10, 1798, exactly at the end of
1,260 years predicted in Scripture!
As Paul Harvey so often says, we need to hear “the rest of the story.” The
prophecies about “the little horn” and “the beast” do not stop with the 1,260-
year period, the deadly “wound by the sword,” or the beast’s “captivity.”
There’s more. In words of deep significance, Scripture predicts, “…his deadly
wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast” (Revelation
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
102
13:3 KJV). Is this happening now? There is no question about it! The former
deadly wound inflicted upon papal Rome now hardly needs a bandaid. With
over a billion members, the Vatican is now the headquarters of the most powerful
religious organization on Planet Earth. In spite of horrendous sex scandals
which have embarrassed the Roman Church, when the Pope addresses
America or the United Nations, the global community listens.
In 1990, 16-book bestselling author Malachi Martin published his fascinating
work, The Keys of this Blood: The Struggle for World Dominion Between
Pope John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Capitalist West. Before his death
in 1999, Martin was not only a highly esteemed former professor at the
Pontifical Biblical Institute of the Vatican, but also a nationally sought-after
radio and TV guest on Vatican affairs. The Washington Post even referred to
his “uncanny accuracy” and insights.
In his 1990 The Keys of this Blood, Martin suggested that in his time
there were only three powers capable of ruling the world—Russia, America,
and the Vatican. Of those three, Martin predicted that the Roman Church
would win in the struggle over “who will hold and wield the dual power of
authority and control over each of us as individuals and over all of us together
as a community; over the entire six billion people expected by demographers
to inhabit the earth by early in the third millennium.”62 Along with the
Pope himself, Martin upheld “the papacy as the ultimate arbiter for problems
and dilemmas affecting nations all over the globe”63 because it alone is the
“Mother of all men’s souls.”64
At the beginning of The Keys, Martin glanced back “fifteen hundred
years and more” when “Rome kept as strong a hand as possible in each local
community around the wide world.” Then he significantly referred to “two
hundred years of inactivity” which had “been imposed on the papacy by the
major secular powers of the world.”65 Do you realize the significance of this?
Counting back two hundred years from 1990 takes us to 1790, only eight
years away from the inflicting of the wound! True to history, Martin looks
back to the “the nineteenth century” when “Pius VI and Pius VII left Rome,
but only because they were kidnapped by French governments and imprisoned
on French soil.”66 Precisely.
Unconscious of the prophetic connection, Martin continued by saying
that after “some two hundred years of official nonexistence…the distinguishing
mark of John Paul’s career as Pontiff” has been to “throw off the
straight jacket of papal activity in major world affairs.”67 Malachi boasted of
the “Slavic Pope” who has “a new eye toward a purpose that is as old as the
papacy itself…an eye that was not merely international, but truly global.”68
The basic message of The Keys of this Blood is, “Papal Rome is back, the
wound is healing, and the Vatican’s goal is world dominion.” Whether the
The Return of the Wounded Beast
103
papacy ever achieves this or not, Bible prophecy does predict Rome’s return to
power and resurrected global influence.
It’s a fact: In our 21st century, there is no president, statesman, or even
rock-and-roll singer, including Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Madonna, or
Britney Spears, who can gather a larger crowd than the Pope. In 1995, the
front cover of Time magazine labeled Pope John Paul II its “Man of the Year.”
“When he talks, it is not only to his flock of nearly a billion; he expects the
world to listen. And the flock and the world listen.”69
No doubt you have heard of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
World. They were magnificent structures, colossal monuments. One was
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Another The Great Pyramid of Giza. In
our modern times, people stand amazed at the developments of technology—
computers, the Internet, satellite communications, fiber optics, and
stem cell research. Yet there is another “wonder” predicted in Revelation
which also applies to our 21st century world. It’s the wonder of a wounded
beast now healing.
The Holy Bible says:
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and
his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after
the beast (Revelation 13:3 KJV).
Have Protestants lost their swords? Why don’t they discern the fulfillment
of prophecy?
Because they are waiting for Nicolae.

Chapter 18
The I.D. of Antichrist
If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have
at least to consider the possibility that we have a small
aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands.
— Douglas Noel Adams (1952-)
Each time I travel overseas, I always carry my passport so I can identify
myself before local or government officials. After comparing my face with my
photo, they know it’s me. In America, my driver license serves the same purpose.
It lists my name, birth date, height, hair color, and current address. These
details are not so much for information, but for identification. That’s the issue.
In addition to the other puzzle pieces we’ve found so far, the Bible
gives us another highly practical clue to help us identify that which is
truly antichrist.
Notice carefully:
…Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the
flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus
Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of
the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now
already in the world (1 John 4:2-3).
Again John wrote:
For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess
Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
antichrist (2 John 7).
105
Thus the Bible plainly says twice that a denial that “Jesus Christ has
come in the flesh” is a definite mark of antichrist. To continue my analogy, if
you ever wonder whether something or someone might be antichrist, just
look closely at the information on their passport or driver license. If you see
the words, “Does Not Confess Jesus Christ Has Come in the Flesh,” you have
your answer.
Every Christian should “confess” Jesus has come in the flesh. But this
confession must be more than a lips-only statement that Jesus Christ was a
real person who was born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, and died on a cross
for our sins. Amazingly, a person may confess all this and yet still be a
“deceiver and an antichrist” (2 John 7). According to the Bible, our confession
must be more specific. We must confess Jesus Christ has come in the
flesh. And this confession must be genuine, from the heart, prompted by the
Spirit of God (see 1 John 4:2). What does it really mean that “Jesus Christ is
come in the flesh”? Let’s delve deeper and find out.
“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14). “The Word”
was Jesus Christ before His nativity in Bethlehem. “The Word became flesh”
simply means the infinite Son of God became Man. Here’s a key question:
What kind of flesh did Jesus become when He fused with humanity? Paul
answered with the utmost clarity: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers
of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same”
(Hebrews 2:14 KJV, emphasis added). Don’t miss it. Paul said Jesus took “the
same” flesh as “the children” have. “The children” doesn’t apply to Adam
and Eve, for they were never babies but were created directly by God in the
Garden of Eden. Rather, “the children” applies to their descendants after sin
entered the world, that is, to fallen humanity.
“As the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise
took part of the same” (Hebrews 2:14, emphasis added). Thus the Bible
plainly says Jesus Christ Himself “took part” of the same flesh we have. You
might ask, “So what? What does this have to do with antichrist?”
First, we must understand what “the flesh” is. “The flesh” is a biblical
expression which describes our basic human nature as it has been affected by
sin. Paul said, “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good
dwells…” (Romans 7:18). In other words, the flesh itself is bad. It’s our
enemy. It’s like a nasty cesspool that often stinks and seeks to drag us down.
“The flesh” is the channel through which satan works to tempt us and lead
us into actual sin.
One of the most impenetrable mysteries found in the Bible is the truth
that God sent “His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh” (Romans 8:3,
emphasis added). It may be hard to fathom, but Jesus Christ “took” upon
Himself the very same flesh we have. Why did He do it? So He could relate

106
to us, understand our struggles, experience our temptations, and reach us
where we are. In other words, God didn’t simply send us a rope. He entered
our world’s slime and mud to get us out of it!
Yet in all of this, there is one monumental truth we must never forget,
or we will drift into heresy. Even though Jesus “took” our sinful flesh and
shared our humanity, He never committed one sin. He was “in all points tempted
as we are, yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15, emphasis added). In spite of His
real connection with human flesh, Jesus Himself—in His thoughts, feelings
and character—remained “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners”
(Hebrews 7:26). This is exactly what the Bible says. By taking our flesh but
not participating in its evil, Jesus literally “condemned sin in the flesh”
(Romans 8:3), which means He met and conquered the very temptations
that give us so much trouble.
Not only did Jesus defeat our flesh in our behalf, but He also died for all
of our sins wherein we have yielded to temptation (see 1 Corinthians 15:3).
Thus He is a perfect and complete Savior! After His total victory over satan,
Jesus ascended to Heaven to become our High Priest. Notice the following
connection between Christ’s being tempted in the flesh down here and His
present ability up there as our High Priest to help us in our struggles.
Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the
heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession [or
confession]. For we have not an high priest which cannot be
touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points
tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come
boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need (Hebrews 4:14-16 KJV).
Fantastic! Jesus Christ is now our High Priest in glory. Because He took
our fallen flesh down here and conquered it, we can come directly to Him by
faith up there for mercy, grace, and spiritual power. It’s true. Today, at this
very moment, we have immediate access to His throne. Christ earnestly
solicits our approach. We can “come boldly”!
Michael Dell has made Dell Computer Corporation one of the fastest
growing and most successful companies in the world. How did he do it? By
his business model—Be Direct. Dell computers are not found at Best Buy,
Circuit City, or Comp-USA. The only way to get one is to go directly to Dell
and order one. The genius of the Dell model is that it bypasses the middleman,
makes more money, and saves us money. That’s their secret. It’s the
same with Jesus Christ. Because He took our flesh, becoming one of us, we
can “be direct.” Today, as our High Priest, Jesus lovingly, tenderly and
earnestly invites us to bypass all middlemen and come straight to His throne.
The I.D. of Antichrist
107
Hebrews 2:17-18 also firmly connects Jesus Christ’s coming in the flesh
with His High Priestly ministry and with His present ability to save us from sin.
Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that
He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining
to God…For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted,
He is able to aid those who are tempted (Hebrews 2:17-18).
Again the truth is established. Because Jesus Christ was made like us in
the flesh and was tempted like we are, He is now fully able as our High Priest
to help us when we’re tempted. His arms are open wide. Even though we are
unworthy and foolish sinners, we can still “come boldly to the throne of
grace” (Hebrews 4:16). We need no other mediator. We can “be direct.” This
is all part of our confession.
It’s time to tie this in with antichrist. As we have already seen, it was
the teaching of the major Protestant Reformers that the “little horn” (Daniel
7:8), the “beast” (Revelation 13:1), and “the man of sin” (2 Thessalonians
2:3) all apply to papal Rome. So here’s the all-important question. Does the
Roman Church genuinely confess “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh”? On
the surface it claims to do so, but let’s take a closer look.
One of the official doctrines, or “confessions,” of the Church of Rome
is a dogma called The Immaculate Conception. Contrary to what many
think, this does not refer to the birth of Jesus as a sinless baby, but rather to
the conception of Mary herself inside her own mother’s womb. The dogma
teaches that when Mary was conceived, she was miraculously preserved from
all original sin. Thus her nature was “immaculate,” or sinless, and therefore
fundamentally different from ours. In other words, according to papal teaching,
Jesus’ mother did not have exactly the same flesh and nature that we
have. Now don’t miss this. What is the implication of this teaching?
According to papal Rome’s official statements, when Jesus Christ was born,
He took Mary’s supposedly sinless nature, not ours. If you think about it, this is
really a denial that “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh” (1 John 4:3)!
Here’s the proof from official, Vatican-approved sources:
This is what the dogma of the Immaculate Conception
confesses [this is their own word], as Pope Pius IX proclaimed
in 1854: The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first
moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege
of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ,
Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain
of original sin.70
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
108
As a consequence, according to the Roman Church, when Jesus Christ
was born, He took Mary’s perfect nature, not our fallen one. The famous
Cardinal Gibbons said it this way:
In other words we affirm that the Second Person of the
Blessed Trinity…by being born of the Virgin, [took] to
Himself, from her maternal womb, a human nature of the
same substance with hers…a true human nature of the same
substance with her own.71
This doctrine of The Immaculate Conception with its idea of the
entrance of Jesus into Mary’s sinless nature, not ours, really removes Christ
“one gigantic step away from mankind.” As a result of this dogma and others,
Rome doesn’t teach sinners to “be direct” by going straight to our heavenly
Father through His Son Jesus Christ for free forgiveness. Instead, the Vatican
encourages poor sinners to come to Jesus through Mary, popes, priests, and
saints—that is, through the mediation of the Roman Church itself. Even
more than this, Rome declares that by virtue of Mary’s Immaculate
Conception and supposedly sinless life, she now has a “saving office” in addition
to her Son. Through Mary’s “manifold intercession,” she is now our
“Advocate, Helper, Benefactress, and Mediatrix” who can “bring us the gifts
of eternal salvation” and “deliver our souls from death.”72
Thus, in her official teachings, in spite of appearances, the Roman
Church really denies “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh” (1 John 4:3, emphasis
added), that is, in “the same” (Hebrews 2:14, emphasis added) fallen flesh
the rest of us have. No matter what she may deceptively claim, Rome’s declaration
that Mary is now our “Advocate” and “Mediatrix” swerves sinners
away from childlike trust in Jesus Christ alone, and thus really “denies the
Father and the Son” (1 John 2:22). God’s Word says, “Every spirit that does
not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is
the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now
already in the world” (1 John 4:3, emphasis added).
According to the Bible, “the spirit of the Antichrist” was “already”
working in John’s own day (church history records a group called Gnostics
who denied Jesus Christ’s coming in the flesh in the first century). As history
progressed, the same spirit later reared its head through the Immaculate
Conception idea. Today, “the spirit of the Antichrist” continues its subtle
efforts through various individuals and organizations around the world to
entice humanity away from direct faith in the Friend of sinners.
Personally, I think “the spirit of the Antichrist” can also work through
popular TV shows, flesh-flaunting models, and hip-hop musicians. The same
chapter that talks about the spirit of the Antichrist also says, “They are of the
world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them. We
The I.D. of Antichrist
109
are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear
us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error” (1 John 4:5-6,
emphasis added). Ultimately, any spiritual influence that leads away from
Jesus Christ comes from the greatest anti-Christ being of all, lucifer himself.
Now let me ask you personally, is your own flesh dragging you down? Are
you struggling with tobacco, alcohol, pornography, appetite, bitterness, an
evil temper, or pride? If so (and who isn’t struggling with at least one sin?), I
have good news for you. Not only did God’s Son pay the full price on the
cross for all our sins (see 1 Corinthians 15:3) thus enabling Him to forgive us
totally, but “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh” (1 John 4:2, emphasis added).
Yes, He “took” our flesh and conquered it! And now, as our High Priest, “He
is also able to save to the uttermost [the ‘guttermost,’ as William Booth of the
Salvation Army used to say] those who come to God through Him, since He
always lives to make intercession for them” (Hebrews 7:25).
Because Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, He alone is our Savior,
Intercessor, and Mediator. He is our High Priest—we need no other. “There
is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus”
(1 Timothy 2:5, emphasis added). Our almighty Savior has enough Godpower
to deliver us from the flesh’s deadly grip, no matter how tightly it
holds us. He loves us all, and He now invites Jews, Protestants, Catholics,
Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Democrats, Republicans, alcoholics, prostitutes,
drug addicts, and everyone else to be direct and come boldly to His
“throne of grace” for undeserved mercy, free forgiveness, and spiritual
power to overcome evil.
Even if you feel like Mr. Weakness himself, Jesus Christ is Mr. Strong.
His encouraging word is, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is
made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).
Do you trust Him today?

Chapter 19
Battle of the Isms
That men do not learn very much from the lessons of
history is the most important of all the lessons that history
has to teach.
— Aldous Leonard Huxley (1894-1963)
As we have already seen, the major Protestant Reformers had one primary
passion: To inspire sinners to “believe on the Lord Jesus Christ” (Acts
16:31) and to obey God’s Word above the traditions of men (see Mark 7:13).
But as they tried to lead their English and European countrymen to the Bible
alone, to Christ alone, to His grace alone, and to faith alone, they encountered
fierce opposition from the Roman Church hierarchy. As persecution
increased, it drove them deeper into their Bibles.
Eventually, they turned to the prophecies. By candlelight they pondered
Paul’s prediction about “the falling away,” and a mysterious antichrist
who would take his seat in “the temple of God” (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).
With trembling they read about “the beast” (Revelation 13:1) and that “little
horn” with “eyes like the eyes of a man,” “a mouth speaking great things,”
who would make bloody “war against the saints” (Daniel 7:8,21). Finally,
through the Holy Spirit’s illumination, they put the pieces of the puzzle
together and came to this solemn conclusion: They had discovered both Jesus
Christ and antichrist.
“There are two great truths that stand out in the
preaching that brought about the Protestant Reformation,”
American Bible Commentator, Ralph Woodrow, reminds us,
“The just shall live by faith, not by the works of Romanism
111
and the Papacy is the Antichrist of Scripture.” It was a message
for Christ and against Antichrist. The entire
Reformation rests upon this twofold testimony. 73
John Wycliffe in England, Martin Luther in Germany, John Calvin in
France, John Knox in Scotland, Ulrich Zwingli in Switzerland, and countless
others, all preached that the humble Nazarene was the Christ and that the
proud Roman papacy was the antichrist of Scripture. As a result of this highimpact,
double-edged message—for Christ and against antichrist—the river
of history literally changed its course. Hundreds of thousands of people in
Europe and England forsook the Roman Church.
H. Grattan Guinness provides this stirring testimony, not only of
the effects of the Reformation, but also of one of the mightiest instruments
in its accomplishment—the preaching of God’s holy prophecies
about the antichrist:
The sixteenth century presents the spectacle of a
stormy sunrise after a dismal night. Europe awoke from long
sleep of superstition. The dead arose. The witnesses to truth
who had been silenced and slain stood up once more and
renewed their testimony. The martyred confessors reappeared
in the Reformers. There was a cleansing of the spiritual
sanctuary. Civil and religious liberty were inaugurated.
The discovery of printing and revival of learning accelerated
the movement. There was progress everywhere. Columbus
struck across the ocean and opened a new hemisphere to
view. Rome was shaken on her seven hills, and lost one-half
of her dominions. Protestant nations were created. The
modern world was called into existence….74
From the first, and throughout, that movement was
energized and guided by the prophetic word. Luther never
felt strong and free to war against the papal apostasy till he
recognized the pope as antichrist. It was then that he
burned the Papal bull. Knox’s first sermon, the sermon
which launched him on his mission as a reformer, was on
the prophecies concerning the Papacy. The reformers
embodied their interpretations of prophecy in their confessions
of faith, and Calvin in his “Institutes.” All the
reformers were unanimous in the matter; even the mild and
cautious Melanchthon was as assured of the antipapal
meaning of these prophecies as was Luther himself. And
their interpretation of these prophecies determined their
reforming action. It led them to protest against Rome with
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
112
extraordinary strength and undaunted courage. It nerved
them to resist the claims of that apostate Church to the
uttermost. It made them martyrs; it sustained them at the
stake. And the views of the reformers were shared by thousands,
by hundreds of thousands. They were adopted by
princes and peoples. Under their influence nations abjured
their allegiance to the false priest of Rome. In the reaction
which followed, all the powers of hell seemed to be let
loose upon the adherents of the Reformation. War followed
war; tortures, burnings, and massacres were multiplied. Yet
the Reformation stood undefeated and unconquerable.
God’s word upheld it, and the energies of His almighty
Spirit. It was the work of Christ as truly as the founding of
the Church eighteen centuries ago; and the revelation of
the future which He gave from heaven—that prophetic
book with which the Scripture closes—was one of the
mightiest instruments employed in its accomplishment.75
As you can imagine, papal Rome rose to its own defense in what
became known as the Counter Reformation. In 1545, she convened a special
council destined to become the heart of her central intelligence operation
against Martin Luther and the Protestants. This famous council took place in
northern Italy in the city of Trent, and is now known as the Council of Trent.
During its many sessions (which continued until 1563), the leaders of the
Vatican developed a highly sophisticated “game plan” to counteract the
reformers. Up to this point, Rome’s main method of attack had been largely
frontal—the open burning of Bibles and of heretics. Yet this type of warfare
only confirmed Protestant convictions that papal Rome was indeed the very
beast which would “make war with the saints” (Revelation 13:7). A new tactic
was needed, something less obvious. This is where the Jesuits came in.
On August 15, 1534, Ignatius of Loyola (1491–1556) founded the
Society of Jesus, otherwise known as the Jesuits. “From the very outset of the
Reformation, the Jesuit Order hung upon its heels as closely as its shadow.”76
This highly secretive and militant Catholic order has a dark history of
intrigue and sedition; that’s why its members were expelled from Portugal
(1759), France (1764), Spain (1767), Naples (1767), and Russia (1820).
“Jesuit priests have been known throughout history as the most wicked political
arm of the Roman Catholic Church. Edmond Paris, in his scholarly
work, The Secret History of the Jesuits, reveals and documents much of this
information.”77
The conflict between Romanism and Protestantism
was basic and irreconcilable. The Romanist believed in the
authority of the Church; the Protestant, in that of the Bible.
Battle of the Isms
113
The one yielded his conscience to the priest; the other, to
God alone. The Romanist believed in the pope as the visible
representative of Christ on earth; the Protestant looked,
instead, upon the pope as Antichrist.78
At the Council of Trent, papal leaders and Jesuits brainstormed about
how to counteract Protestantism and bring defectors back to the mother
church. Behind closed doors, they decided this was to be done, not only
through the Inquisition and torture, but also through theology. What kind of
theology? Here’s the answer: By reinterpreting the prophecies about “the man
of sin,” “the little horn,” and “the beast”!
Two very intelligent Spanish Jesuits rose to the challenge, Luis de
Alcasar (1554-1613) of Seville and Francisco Ribera (1537-1591) of
Salamanca. Their strategy was, in a nutshell, one of reapplication and diversion,
yet they went in opposite directions. After reading the Bible by candlelight
like Martin Luther did, Alcasar decided to apply the Bible’s antichrist
prophecies to the ancient past while Ribera applied them to the distant future.
“Smart move!” was the response from Rome. By reapplying these prophecies
to the past and to the future instead of to the present, these two tricky Jesuit
scholars sought to divert the prophetic finger light-years away from the
Vatican. Their views quickly became official positions within the Roman
Church—even though these two views contradicted each other!
Notice these significant quotations:
Accordingly, towards the close of the century of the
Reformation, two of her [Rome’s] most learned doctors set
themselves to the task, each endeavoring by different means
to accomplish the same end, namely, that of diverting men’s
minds from perceiving the fulfillment of the prophecies of
the Antichrist in the Papal system. The Jesuit Alcasar devoted
himself to bring into prominence the Preterist method of
interpretation to show the prophecies of Antichrist were fulfilled
before the Popes ever ruled at Rome, and therefore
could not apply to the Papacy. On the other hand the Jesuit
Ribera tried to set aside the application of the prophecies to
Papal Power by bringing out the Futurist system, which
asserts that these prophecies refer properly not to the career
of the Papacy, but to that of some future supernatural individual,
who is yet to appear, and to continue in power for
three and a half years.79
In 1590, Ribera published a commentary on the
Revelation as a counter-interpretation to the prevailing view
among Protestants which identified the Papacy with the
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
114
Antichrist. Ribera applied all of Revelation but the earliest
chapters to the end time rather than to the history of the
Church. Antichrist would be a single evil person who would
be received by the Jews and would rebuild Jerusalem.80
Even the Catholic writer, G.S. Hitchcock, confirmed the origin of these
anti-Protestant counter-theories:
The Futurist School, founded by the Jesuit Ribera in
1591, looks for Antichrist, Babylon, and a rebuilt temple in
Jerusalem, at the end of the Christian Dispensation.
The Praeterist School, founded by the Jesuit Alcasar in
1614, explains Revelation by the Fall of Jerusalem or by the
fall of Pagan Rome in 410 A.D.81
It’s time to clarify three important isms—preterism, futurism, and historicism—
which reflect three competing schools of prophetic interpretation.
Such clarification will help you grasp the core issues. I will explain each term
broadly, and even mention some names, with this disclaimer: Just because a
person is listed in the preterist, futurist, or historicist camp in their interpretation
of prophecy doesn’t necessarily mean that every doctrine they teach is
right or wrong. Neither does it mean that they are necessarily saved or lost.
That’s up to Jesus Christ. Persons in each school (both past and present) may
teach truth in one area, yet error in another. Also, some may teach wrong
things, give them up, and then teach right things. Life is rarely simple. I’m
thankful God Himself is the all-knowing Judge of hearts, motives, characters,
and destinies, not man. “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
(Genesis 18:25) Yes. In the Judgment Day, He’ll sort it all out.
PRETERISM
Preterism is what Luis de Alcasar taught. Its prefix,
“pre,” points back to the past. Preterism sees the majority (or
all) of the prophecies found in Matthew 24 and the Book of
Revelation as having already been fulfilled in either the fall
of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. or in the fall or Rome. For preterists,
“the end of the world” usually means “the end of the Jewish
world.” Full-preterists believe even the second coming of
Jesus Christ somehow mystically occurred in 70 A.D.,
whereas partial-preterists still believe in a future, literal
return of the Savior. Concerning the core issue—who is the
antichrist?—preterists usually see the Roman Emperor Nero
as the number-one candidate.82 Compared with futurism and
historicism, preterism has always been a minority viewpoint
within the church, yet it is now making increased inroads
Battle of the Isms
115
into 21st century Christianity. 83 Developed in the 1600’s by
the Jesuit Alcasar into a full anti-Protestant system, preterism
strategically removes the “little horn!” stigma away from
the Vatican. Jesuit objective achieved.
FUTURISM
Futurism is what Francisco Ribera taught. In contrast
to preterism, futurism usually sees the majority of
Revelation’s prophecies (from chapter 4 onward) as yet on
the horizon. Concerning the antichrist, instead of preterism’s
application to Nero in the past, futurism generally applies
the prophecies of “the little horn,” “the man of sin,” and “the
beast” to a single, yet-future Mr. Serpent who will slither
into history during time’s last sliver (now usually seen as a
“seven-year” sliver). Compared to preterism and historicism,
futurism has by far the most adherents in the 21st century as
the majority report. As with preterism, futurism’s net result
is that it also significantly wipes away “the beast!” stain from
the papacy. Jesuit objective achieved again.
HISTORICISM
In staunch opposition to both preterism and futurism is
historicism, which is what the vast majority of Protestants
used to teach. In essence, historicism teaches straight-forward,
chronological progression by saying that the major
prophecies of Daniel and Revelation find fulfillment throughout
Christian history while pointing toward the climactic, visible
second coming of our Savior. Historicism also places special
emphasis on the ongoing struggle between Jesus Christ and
satan inside the Christian church. It takes note of Paul’s predictions
about “the falling away” (2 Thessalonians 2:3), a
subsequent departure from the original faith (see 1 Timothy
4:1), and also discerns prophetic fulfillment in the rise of the
Roman church which, although a professedly Christian
institution (with real Christians inside it), nevertheless
teaches doctrines which divert the mind from simple trust in
the all-sufficient merits of the sin-pierced Sufferer. While
not wanting to attack honest individuals, historicism still
points the prophetic finger at the Vatican by calling it “the
little horn,” “the man of sin,” “the beast,” and “Mystery
Babylon.” Jesuit objective not achieved.
Describing historicism as the truest and most reasonable method of
interpretation, E.B. Elliott comments on the entire Book of Revelation:
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
116
Its subject matter I assume to be the continuous fortunes
of the church and of the world, (that is of the Roman
world and Christian church settled therein,) from the time of
the revelation being given, or time of St. John’s banishment,
to the end of all things.84
In another description of the “historic Protestant view of the
Apocalypse,” Elliott wrote:
[T]hat view regards the prophecy as a pre-figuration of
the great events that were to happen in the Church, and the
world connected with it, from St. John’s time to the consummation;
including specially the establishment of
Popedom, and the reign of Papal Rome, as in some way or
the other the fulfillment of the types of the Apocalyptic
Beast and Babylon.85
Historicist teachers of the past (and present), far from being aberrant
theologians, include some of Christianity’s most illustrious scholars: John
Wycliffe, William Tyndale, Martin Luther, Philip Melanchthon, Ulrich
Zwingli, Robert Barnes, Nicholas Ridley, Hugh Latimer, Joseph Mede, Sir
Isaac Newton, John Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, James
Aitken Wylie, Merle D’Aubigne, John Foxe, Matthew Henry, Albert Barnes,
John Bunyan, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Henry Grattan Guinness, Richard
Baxter, Edward Bishop Elliott, Bishop J.C. Ryle, Baron Porcelli, Alan
Campbell, Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, Richard Bennett, Michael de Semlyen,
Timothy Kauffman, Jim Dodson, Reg Barrow, Richard Bacon, Robert J.
Nicholson, Dr. Bill Jackson, Rob Mays, Dr. John Robbins, Bill Kalivas, Dr.
Val Finnell, Dwight Nelson, Dr. Charles Roberts, Dr. Francis Nigel Lee,
Doug Batchelor, Robert Caringola,, Mark Finley, Dr. Ian Paisley, etc. These
may not see eye to eye on every doctrinal detail; but they’ve all discerned the
fulfillment of prophecy in church history and especially in the anti-Christ
nature of the papacy as a colossal institution whose doctrines deny the New
Testament message of free salvation by grace through simple faith in the
Crucified and Risen One, apart from works.
In the minds of true historicists, sincere preterists and futurists have had
at least one of their eyes poked out concerning this unquestionable historical
reality. Futurism, which is by far the most popular school today, possesses the
incredible ability to sweep 1,500 years of living prophetic history under the
proverbial rug by inserting its infamous GAP into the visions of Daniel and
Revelation. In a nutshell, the GAP or parenthesis theory teaches that when
Jerusalem or Rome fell, prophecy stopped, only to continue again near the
time of the rapture. As we have already seen, futurism also stops the clock
between the 69th and 70th weeks of Daniel 9:24-27. Thus Daniel’s 70th
Battle of the Isms
117
week, the ten horns in Daniel 7, the “little horn,” “the beast” and “the man
of sin” all have nothing to do with Christians today. “It is this GAP theory
that permeates Futurism’s interpretation of all apocalyptic prophecy.”86
According to most Futurists (and Preterists), how many prophecies were fulfilled
during the Dark Ages when literally millions of God’s people were
burnt to ashes in wars against the saints? None. Zilch. Zero. Historicists see
something terribly wrong with this picture!
At its best, historicism also recognizes that there were indeed prophecies
fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem (thus preterists aren’t all wrong),
yet it also stands for the reality of future events such as the mark of the beast
(see Revelation 14:9-12), the seven last plagues (see Revelation 16), the battle
of Armageddon (see Revelation 16:16), the return of Jesus Christ (see
Revelation 14:14-16), a 1000-year period (see Revelation 20), the final
judgment (see Revelation 20:11-13), the lake of fire (see Revelation 20:15)
and the new earth (see Revelation 21:1). Thus futurists have some truth also.
Yet again, the hallmark of historicism as a prophetic system is its ability to
discern prophecy fulfilled in history—the rise of the papacy, the Christ-centered
preaching of the Reformation onward, a final crisis, and the glorious
return of our Lord and Savior, with NO GAPS!
While this book cannot attempt a detailed analysis of all of
Revelation’s prophecies, let it suffice to say that historicists such as Elliott,
Guinness and countless others have interpreted the seals of Revelation 6,87
the trumpets of Revelation 8 and 9,88 the prophesying of the two witnesses
in Revelation 11,89 the woman fleeing into the wilderness in Revelation
12,90 and “the blood of the martyrs of Jesus” (Revelation 17:6) as referring
to real events in church history.
BRIEF HISTORICIST SPOTLIGHT ON REVELATION 9
In the wake of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center in
New York City, Americans are now acutely aware of the frightening power of
militant Islam and its Al Qaeda terrorist network. Considering the global
influence of “the House of Mohammed” and the increasing likelihood that it
will play a major role in end time events (along with the papacy and other
anti-Christ entities), this vital question should be asked: Have Protestant
historicists discerned the rise of Islamic militancy within the pages of
Revelation? While it is outside the scope of this book (which presents simply
Historicism 101) to discuss in detail the teachings of Mohammed and of his
Qur’an, the facts reveal that historicists have seen Islam predicted in various
Scriptures—most notably in the 5th and 6th trumpets of Revelation 9!
Revelation 9 portrays “smoke” rising out of “the bottomless pit”
(verse 2) and an awful swarm of “locusts” spreading havoc across the earth
(verses 3-12). Apollyon, Book Five of the futuristic Left Behind series,
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
118
interprets these locusts literally, as “flying creatures—hideous, ugly, brown
and black and yellow flying monsters”91; “…an amalgam of metal, spiny
protrusions, and insect slime.”92
Not so with historicists. While you must do your own careful research,
you should be aware that historicists of the past—based on a detailed comparison
of biblical imagery with history—have consistently applied the
locust-prophecy of Revelation 9 to Muslim armies swarming out of the
Arabian Desert.93 Martin Luther wrote: “The second woe is the sixth angel,
the shameful Mohammed, with his companions the Saracens, who inflicted
a great plague on the Church—with their doctrines and with the sword.”94
John Wesley observed, “All this agrees with the slaughter which the Saracens
made for a long time after Mahomet’s [Mohammed’s] death.”95 Elliott reported
that “…most other Protestant interpreters” saw “the 5th and 6th trumpets”
as applying to the “Saracens and Turks [Muslim hordes].”96 This view
was also shared by “Downham, Brightman, Mede, Parker, Durham, Goodwin,
Increase Mather, Sherwin, Jurieu, Flemming, Cotton Mather, Daubuz, Sir
Isaac Newton, Jonathan Edwards, Bishop Thomas Newton, John Gill, John
Brown of Haddington, Winthrop, Thomas Scott, Fuller, James Angell
Brown, Alexander Keith, Bickersteth, Louis Gaussen, Albert Barnes”97 and
countless others.
To His warning about “false prophets” (Matthew 24:24) Jesus added,
“Therefore if they say to you, ‘Look, He is in the desert!’ do not go out…”
(Matthew 24:26, emphasis added). Along with Luther, many Protestants
have seen here a prediction about Mohammed, the false desert prophet,
whose Qur’an clearly rejects the full divinity of Jesus Christ and the allsufficiency
of His saving gospel. As we have already seen, John wrote,
“Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist
who denies the Father and the Son” (1 John 2:22). Mohammed did deny
that God is a “Father” who has a “Son.” The Qur’an itself states, “…the
Messiah, Isa [Jesus] son of Marium [Mary] is only an apostle of
Allah…Allah is only one God: far be it from His glory that He should have
a son.”98 Thus Mohammed himself—according to the New Testament—
may legitimately be called a “false prophet,” “a deceiver and an
antichrist” (2 John 7, emphasis added). The same can be said of many
other ancient and modern religious teachers who have given birth to supposedly
enlightened movements. Historicists, along with many other
evangelical Christians today, see Islam as another end time delusion.
HISTORICISTS AND REVELATION 12
Unlike preterists or futurists, historicists see “the woman” who “fled
into the wilderness” for “1,260 days” (Revelation 12:6,13-14) as applying to
“Christ’s Church in the wilderness” which was persecuted during the “1260
Battle of the Isms
119
years” by “the Romish Church…the harlot-usurper.”99 Thus the true Church
was smitten by the harlot church described as “drunk with the blood of the
saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus” (Revelation 17:6). This is
Protestantism—true historicism.
Think about it. Preterists say most (if not all) of God’s great prophecies
came to a screeching halt almost two thousand years ago. Does this make
sense? Why would God inspire such a wonderful Book as “Revelation” and
then stop its application around 70 A.D. (or with the fall of Rome), when He
knew time would continue much longer? In essence, preterism’s view is: From
Nero until now there’s nothing! How about futurism? Is it any more reasonable?
Why would God leave His Church “prophecyless” from John’s day until
the end times? To futurists, there’s hardly anything from the resurrection to
the rapture to be prophetically fulfilled. Futurism leaps over Rome’s demise,
the great apostasy, Islamic origins, papal power, the Dark Ages, the
Inquisition, and the Reformation almost entirely. Historicism responds,
“Wait a minute! This makes no sense.” With Holy Ghost perception, historicists
not only see mighty prophecies fulfilled throughout church history—
in papal and Islamic scourges—but they label both preterism and futurism in
their origins as rooted in the counter-Reformation and in Jesuit ingenuity —
the activity of antichrist.
As to the prophetic antichrist itself—the Beast of prophecy—historicism’s
reason for pinpointing papal Rome and exposing its organization has
nothing to do with malice or “hate crimes” against human beings, but simply
because (quoting Elliott) the antichrist of prophecy “in one way or other,
supersedes Christ himself, in his character of fallen man’s only prophet,
priest, mediator, atonement, and righteousness: thereby teaching apostasy
from the Head, and destroying the very essence of the gospel.”100 Paul asked
some of his early converts who were being subtly led astray from Jesus, “Have
I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?” (Galatians 4:16)
Sometimes truth cuts like a physician’s knife—but its goal is healing, salvation,
and peace through the soothing grace of Jesus Christ.

to be the gracious guidance of God), I am fully persuaded that historicism
most accurately discerns Heaven’s “sure word of prophecy” (2 Peter 1:19 KJV)
in the events of the past, throughout history, and in the approaching climax.
In addition, I am also convinced that the historicist perspective is invaluable

120
to correctly understand and prepare for the future. As Winston Churchill
once said, “The farther backward we look the farther forward we can see.”
I will conclude this chapter with Guinness and Elliott’s classic summaries
of the “Battle of the Isms” that still rages in our 21st-century world of
email, Medicare, high-tech laser surgery, space shuttles, Left Behind novels,
and end time delusions:
[The] futurist system of interpreting the prophecies is
now held, strange to say, by many Protestants, but it was first
invented by the Jesuit Ribera, at the end of the sixteenth
century, to relieve the papacy from the terrible stigma cast
upon it by the Protestant interpretation. This interpretation
was so evidently the true and intended one that the adherents
of the Papacy felt its edge must, at any cost, be turned
or blunted. If the Papacy were the predicted antichrist, as
Protestants asserted, then there was an end to the question,
and separation from it was an imperative duty.
There were only two alternatives. If the antichrist were
not a present power, he must either be a past or a future one.
Some writers asserted that the predictions pointed back to
Nero. This did not take into account the obvious fact that
the antichristian power predicted was to succeed the fall of
the Caesars, and develop among the Gothic nations. The
other alternative became therefore the popular one with the
Papists. Antichrist was future, so Ribera and Bossuet and others
taught. An individual man was intended, not a dynasty;
the duration of his power would not be for twelve and a half
centuries, but only three and a half years; he would be an
open foe of Christ, not a false friend; he would…sit in the
Jewish temple. Speculation about the future took place of
study of the past and present, and careful comparison of the
facts of history with the predictions of prophecy. This related,
so it was asserted, not to the main course of the history of
the Church, but only to the few closing years of her history.
The Papal head of the Church of Rome was not the power
delineated by Daniel and St. John. Accurately as it answered
to the description, it was not the criminal indicated. It must
be allowed to go free, and the detective must look out for
another man, who was sure to turn up by and by…
It is held by many that the historic school of interpretation
is represented only by a small modern section of the
Church. We shall show that it has existed from the beginning,
Battle of the Isms
121
and includes the larger part of the greatest and best teachers
of the church for 1800 years. We shall show that the Fathers
of the Church belonged to it, that the confessors, reformers,
and martyrs belonged to it, and that it included a vast multitude
of erudite expositors of later times. We shall show that
all these have held to the central truth that prophecy faithfully
mirrors the Church’s history as a whole, and not merely a commencing
or closing fragment of that history…
We shall show that the futurist school of interpretation, on
the contrary, is chiefly represented by teachers belonging to the
Church of Rome; that the Popes, cardinals, bishops, and priests
of that apostate Church are all futurists, and that the futurist
interpretation is one of the chief pillars of Romanism…
Is this the position you adopt? Is this the conclusion
you defend? Are these the views you advocate? You, a
Protestant, and this after all that has been written upon the
subject, and all the blaze of light which history and experience
have poured upon it? If it is, look that you be not found
fighting against the truth, warring against the Word of God,
resisting the testimony of the prophetic Spirit; hindering the
work of the Reformation, promoting the progress of the
apostasy, opposing Christ, and helping antichrist.101
Now the words of Elliott:
In conclusion, the readers of this Historic Sketch will
see that there are but three grand Schemes of Apocalyptic
Interpretation that can be considered as standing up face to
face against each other…The 1st is that of the Praeterists;
respecting the subject of prophecy, except in its two or three
last chapters [of Revelation], to the catastrophes of the
Jewish nation and old Roman Empire…which Scheme, originally
propounded, as we saw, by the Jesuit Alcasar, and then
adopted by Grotius…by Professor Moses Stuart in the
United States of America, and by disciples in the German
School in England…
The 2nd is the Futurist Scheme; making the whole of
the Apocalyptic Prophecy, (excepting perhaps the primary
Vision and the Letters to the Seven Churches,) to relate to
things now future, viz. the things concerning Christ’s second
Advent: a Scheme first set forth, [as] we saw, by the Jesuit
Ribera, at the end of the 16th century; and which in its main
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
122
principle has been urged alike by Dr. S.R. Maitland, Mr.
Burgh, the Oxford Tractator on Antichrist [John Henry
Newman], and others, in our own times and era, not without
considerable success…
The 3rd is what we may call emphatically the Protestant
continuous Historic Scheme of Interpretation; that which
regards the Apocalypse as a pre-figuration in detail of the
chief events affecting the Church and Christendom,
whether secular or ecclesiastical, from St. John’s time to the
consummation:—a Scheme which, in regard of its particular
application of the symbols of Babylon and the Beast to Papal
Rome and Popedom, was early embraced, as we saw, by the
Waldenses, Wickliffites, and Hussites; then adopted with
fuller light by the chief reformers, German, Swiss, French
and English, of the 16th century; and transmitted downwards
uninterruptedly, even to the present time.
It is the last of which [historicism] I embrace for my
own part with a full and ever strengthening conviction of
its truth.102
In the language of Rush Limbaugh listeners who often call his radio program
to agree with his pronouncements, I emphatically say, “Ditto.”

Chapter 20
The Path of the Virus
Oh, how powerfully the magnet of illusion attracts.
— Karl Gutzkow (1811-1878)
Code Red, Melissa, Sircam, Nimba, Loveletter, Klez, Mydoom—what
do they all have in common? They’re computer viruses that can turn one’s
beloved laptop or PC into a terribly malfunctioning machine that becomes
good for nothing. Just as Osama bin Laden became public enemy number one
to the United States of America after September 11, 2001, even so has the
computer virus become public enemy number one to all who sit before a
monitor.
Computer viruses are very sophisticated and destructive software programs
designed by evil people who take pleasure in causing chaos and hurting
others. Tiny technical terrorists, they can slip unnoticed into your computer
and ruin everything. The most common way for a virus to get inside is
via an attachment connected to an apparently friendly email. “Enjoy my family
photos!” the subject line might say. As soon as you click on the attachment
to view the pictures, many times it’s too late. Once the virus is inside
your computer it quickly multiplies itself like a malicious cancer cell. Data
can be removed, files deleted, and everything can get messed up. Eventually
your computer can totally crash; and if that happens, you may lose everything
permanently. It might be time for a new computer.
This chapter is about prophecy, not computers, nevertheless we can
learn many spiritual lessons from the virus. As we have plainly seen, the
Protestant reformers held two core beliefs: 1) Salvation is through the allsufficient
merits of Jesus Christ alone; and 2) Papal Rome is the antichrist
of Scripture. Their prophetic perspective was called historicism. In the lan-
125
guage of computers, we might say that historicism was their basic prophetic
operating system, much like Windows 2000 and Windows XP are now the
main operating systems for most Microsoft-based computers. Even though
computer programs and systems become quickly outdated because of
upgrades to better versions, it is an amazing fact that historicism remained
intact as the primary operating system of most Protestant churches for
almost 400 years. Have you heard the expression, “I’d rather fight than
switch”? That’s how most Protestants felt about historicism from the 1500’s
all the way down to the early 20th century.
But in our 21st century, historicism has faded and futurism is in as the
majority report. What happened? How did the seismic shift take place? The
story is both fascinating and tragic. Here are the highlights. We have
already seen that at the Council of Trent the Roman Church reacted
against the Reformation by commissioning members of the Jesuit Order to
counteract historicism. In a short time, Alcasar and Ribera put forth their
anti-Protestant counter-theories. In this chapter, the inroads of Ribera’s
influence into Protestantism will be traced because, although Alcasar’s
preterism is now making renewed progress into churches, Ribera’s teaching
is overwhelmingly dominant.
Shortly after the Council of Trent, with the blessing of the Pope,
Francisco Ribera master-minded a virus, the virus of futurism. For the next
300 years his Jesuit cohorts did their best to insert this virus into Protestant
churches, especially through educational processes connected with the universities
of Europe, but they failed. Protestants were too smart and they consistently
blocked futurism’s entrance. In addition to effective Holy Ghost
“fire wall” and virus protection, they basically said, “Sorry. We don’t open
foreign attachments!”
But in the 1800’s they dropped their guard.
The Futurism of Ribera never posed a positive threat to
the Protestants for three centuries. It was virtually confined
to the Roman Church. But early in the nineteenth century
it sprang forth with vehemence and latched on to
Protestants of the Established Church of England.103
Dr. Samuel Roffey Maitland (1792-1866), a British lawyer and Bible
scholar, became a librarian to the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth. It
is likely that one day he discovered Ribera’s commentary in the library. In
any event, in 1826 he published a widely read book attacking the
Reformation and supporting the Jesuit idea of a future Mr. Antichrist person.
For the next ten years, in tract after tract, he continued his anti-Reformation
rhetoric. In the language of computers, inside Mr. Maitland’s “Readme file,”
the virus lurked.
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
126
After Dr. Maitland came James H. Todd, professor of Hebrew at the
University of Dublin. Giving credit to Maitland, Todd published his own
futuristic pamphlets and books. Commenting on the views of Maitland and
another so-called Protestant (Mr. Burgh), E.B. Elliott reported how these
“two Protestant writers excus[ed] the Papacy from any concern with the
predicted antichristian apostasy.”104
Next player: John Henry Newman (1801-1890), a member of the
Church of England and a leader of the famous Oxford movement (1833-
1845). In 1850, Newman wrote his “Letter on Anglican Difficulties” blatantly
revealing that one of the goals of the movement was to lead “the various
English denominations and parties” back to Rome. The “Oxford Tracts”
gave fresh weight to “anti-Protestant opinions,” gave “assistance [to] the
laborers of the futurist school,” worked to “unprotestantize the Church of
England” and “set aside all application to the Roman Papacy of the fearful
prophecies respecting Antichrist.”105 After publishing his own pamphlet
about a future Mr. Sinister, Newman himself became a Catholic, and later a
highly honored cardinal. Through the combined influences of Maitland,
Todd, Burgh, Newman, and others, a definite “Romeward movement [had
arisen] destined to sweep away the old Protestant landmarks, as with a
flood.”106 The virus was sneaking in.
Then came the Scottish Presbyterian minister Edward Irving (1792-
1834) who pastored the large Chalcedonian Chapel in London with over
1,000 members. Cofounder of The Society for the Investigation of Prophecy,
Irving eventually accepted the one-man antichrist idea of Newman, Burgh,
Todd, Maitland, Bellarmine, and Ribera, yet he went a step further.
Somewhere around 1830, Edward Irving began to teach the novel idea of a
two-phase return of Christ, the first phase being a secret rapture before the rise
of antichrist.107 Where he got this concept is a matter of hot dispute. Christian
journalist Dave MacPherson has researched this matter for many years. In his
investigative books—The Rapture Plot and The Incredible Cover-Up—Mr.
MacPherson suggests Irving snatched it from a young Scottish girl named
Margaret MacDonald who first “saw” it during an ecstatic “revelation.”108
Regardless of where Irving got it, the fact is, he taught it!
In the midst of this growing anti-Protestant climate in England came
the man we talked about in Chapter 6 of this book, John Nelson Darby
(1800-1882). A brilliant lawyer, pastor, and theologian, Darby wrote more
than 53 books on Bible subjects. On the positive side, he staunchly
defended the infallibility of the Scriptures against British liberalism, and
soon became one of the leaders of an English group called the Plymouth
Brethren. Darby’s contribution to the development of evangelical theology
has been so great he has been called, The Father of Modern
Dispensationalism. Yet John Nelson Darby, like Edward Irving, not only
The Path of the Virus
127
became a champion for the pre-tribulation rapture idea (some say he
grabbed it from Irving, others say he found it on his own), but also of a
future antichrist who appears only after we disappear. Both teachings—a
secret rapture and a future Mr. Ghastly—are now dispensational pillars.
Reporting on Irving and Darby’s rapture-then-antichrist views,
MacPherson wrote:
Into this [futurist] system both Darby and Irving had
injected a further refinement, based upon a declared attempt
to reconcile the different parts of the New Testament which
they considered to be relevant. In their view, the Second
Advent would take place in two stages: first, there would be
a quiet appearance—the “presence”—of Christ, when all
true Christians, the true Church, would be removed from the
earth. This was the “rapture of the saints.” Only then, when
the restraining presence of the Holy Spirit in His own people
had been removed from the world scene, would
Antichrist arise. His rule would be brought to an end by the
second stage of the Advent—the public “appearing” of
Christ in glory. 109
Concerning the highly probable link to Margaret MacDonald,
MacPherson testified:
Since Margaret MacDonald was the first person to
teach a coming of Christ that would precede the days of
Antichrist, it necessarily follows that Darby—back to whom
pre-tribism can easily be traced—was at least the second or
third or even farther down the line. To date no solid evidence
has been found that proves that anyone other than
this young Scottish lassie was the first person to teach a
future coming of Christ before the days of Antichrist. Before
1830 Christians had always believed in a single future coming,
that the catching up of 1 Thess. 4 will take place after
the Great Tribulation of Matthew 24 at the glorious coming
of the Son of man when He shall send His angels to gather
together all of His elect.
Whether she realized it or not, Margaret did her part to
pave the way for the doctrine that would demand separate
waiting rooms at the end of this age—one for the church and
another one for Israel!
Finally, to charge that Darby could never have been
influenced by Margaret’s pre-Antichrist rapture, with the
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
128
knowledge of her revelation and his whereabouts in 1830
now out in the open, is practically the same as saying that a
man found with a smoking revolver in hand and standing
over a freshly killed victim in the middle of a lonely desert
could not possibly be suspect!110
In light of MacPherson’s careful research, it seems Margaret
MacDonald’s pre-Antichrist “rapture revelation” is the real smoking gun
behind Darby’s theology. Regardless, the essential pre-tribulationism of
Margaret’s doctrine soon became a weapon of mass deception in the hands of
Darby and his dispensationalist followers.
Dispensationalism is the theory that God deals with mankind in distinct
periods or ages. According to Darby, we’re now in the “Church Age”
which will conclude with the rapture. Then Daniel’s 70th week will supposedly
kick in during which the antichrist will attack unfortunate Jews. Thus,
in spite of the positive features of his ministry, Darby followed Irving (and
probably Margaret), Newman, Todd, Burgh, Maitland, and Ribera by inserting
the virus of futurism into his theology, now a pre-tribulation rapture theology.
This created a link between John Nelson Darby, the father of modern dispensationalism,
and Francisco Ribera, the ancient Jesuit father of futurism.
Darby visited America six times from 1859 to 1874, preaching in all its major
cities. As American Protestants clicked “open” and received his sermons,
they had no idea the virus was sneaking in, but that’s what happened.
Tragically, the historicism their forefathers were burnt for was being systematically
dragged toward the “recycle bin,” a computer term for the trash can.
One of the most important figures in this whole drama is Cyrus
Ingerson Scofield (1843-1921), a Kansas lawyer who was greatly influenced
by the writings of Darby. In 1909, Scofield published the first edition of his
famous Scofield Reference Bible. In the early 1900’s, this Bible became so
popular in American Protestant Bible schools that literally millions of copies
were printed. What made Scofield’s Bible so energizing was not so much the
Scripture itself, but his footnotes. Yet those footnotes contained the virus. Anti-
Reformation interpretations were inserted that pointed the finger away from
papal Rome and toward a future antichrist. As 20th-century American
Protestants “downloaded” Scofield’s notes into their unsuspecting brains, the
virus attacked file after file linked to historicism, clicking “delete.”
The Moody Bible Institute and the Dallas Theological Seminary
have strongly supported the teachings of John Nelson Darby. Thus these
firmly Christian institutions, in spite of the good they have done and continue
to do, have unknowingly enabled the virus to do what viruses do
best, “multiply rapidly.”
The Path of the Virus
129
Then in the 1970’s, Pastor Hal Lindsey, a graduate of Dallas Theological
Seminary, released his blockbuster book, The Late Great Planet Earth. This
177-page, easy-to-read volume brought futurism to the masses of American
Christianity, and beyond. The New York Times labeled it, “The number one
best-seller of the decade.” Over 30 million copies have been sold, and it has
been translated into over 30 languages. Through The Late Great Planet Earth,
the Jesuit virus of futurism made incredible progress in its ancient intelligence
strategy to replace historicism as the prophetic operating system of the
Protestant world.
Enter Left Behind. In the 1990’s, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins
took the future Mr. Evil idea of Hal Lindsey, Scofield, Darby, Irving,
Newman, Todd, Maitland, and the Jesuit Ribera, and turned it into “The
most successful Christian-fiction series ever” (Publishers Weekly). Lindsey’s
book, The Late Great Planet Earth, was largely theological, while Left
Behind is a fast-moving sequence of highly imaginative novels “overflowing
with suspense, action, and adventure,” a “Christian thriller,” with a
“label its creators could never have predicted: blockbuster success”
(Entertainment Weekly). The novels have reached the bestseller lists of
New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, and have even resulted in an
interview of LaHaye and Jenkins on Larry King Live. Left Behind books are
now available at Wal-Mart, Costco, Target, airports, and inside countless
stores. The central figure of this blockbuster series is Nicolae Carpathia,
representing Mr. Nightmare himself, the after-the-rapture antichrist. The
result? Through Left Behind, the virus of futurism has multiplied exponentially
and practically taken over the prophecy-minded Christian world.
Most Christians expect a future antichrist, which means Protestantism’s
original operating system has crashed!
The proper eschatological term for the view most
taught today is Futurism which fuels the confusion of
Dispensationalism. The futuristic school of Bible prophecy
came from the Roman Catholic Church, specifically her
Jesuit theologians. However the alternative has been
believed for centuries. It is known as Historicism.111
Futurism has crept into the Protestant Church….112
It is a matter for deep regret that those who hold and
advocate the Futurist system at the present day, Protestants
as they are for the most part, are thus really playing into the
hands of Rome, and helping to screen the Papacy from
detection as the Antichrist.113
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
130
I will emphasize a fundamental truth once more; the
Futurist school of Bible prophecy was created for one reason,
and one reason only; to counter the Protestant Reformation!114
Tragically, historicism has been knocked down by a powerful punch, but
let me clarify something—it’s not entirely out of the boxing ring. Mark Twain
once said, “Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.” Though not
as popular as it once was, historicism lives. God’s truth never dies.
Have no fear. Jesus Christ burst forth from a clammy grave, and so will
solidly biblical, historical, Protestant truth before Earth’s final harvest (read
carefully Revelation 14:6-14; 18:1). Nothing takes God by surprise. In “the
time of the end…knowledge shall increase” (Daniel 12:4). Truth will conquer
all alien forces—at least inside the minds of those who are willing to see it.
Before closing this chapter, I want to share one more lesson about the
virus. Only this time we will shift gears—the lesson is not about a bad virus,
but a good one. I don’t watch many movies, but there’s one that has become
an amazing parable to me. Independence Day, released near the 4th of July in
1996. It was a PG-13, sci-fi thriller about a massive fleet of nasty aliens who
came to Earth with a plot to take over the world on the very day of America’s
freedom celebration. While the alien mother ship floated high above Earth’s
atmosphere, deadly daughter ships caused havoc across the globe. The
President of the United States, his team of intelligence officers, and the combined
efforts of the army, navy, and air force were powerless to stop the carnage.
With hope fading fast, humanity’s future looked bleak.
Until the Virus Plan. Two U.S. citizens, one an armed forces pilot (Will
Smith), the other a Jewish computer expert (Jeff Goldblum), teamed up to
carry out an almost impossible mission to save the world. The hi-tech guru
believed that if a certain computer virus could somehow be uploaded from his
laptop into the alien mother ship’s master control center, this could disable
its previously impenetrable protective shield. Then “Pow!” the U.S. could
obliterate it with a nuclear missile.
The Americans had previously taken over one alien spacecraft, which
the pilot said he could fly. Hoping against hope, the two patriots took off,
approached the mother ship, and then tricked it into momentarily letting
down its defense shield which allowed the duo to slip into its inner recesses.
Upon reaching the alien core, they uploaded the virus. It worked. With only
a few seconds left to launch their own missile (timed to explode shortly) and
maneuver their craft out, the heroes just barely managed to escape before the
mother ship exploded. The daughter ships then lost their shields, and were
each soon blown to bits by other missiles launched from around the world. It
all happened on the 4th of July, which became America’s second
The Path of the Virus
131
Independence Day. But this time it was freedom from deadly aliens, thanks
to two brave heroes, and the good virus.
From what I know about preterism and futurism I can’t help thinking of
them as alien forces seeking to control the prophecy-minded Christian
world. That’s what they are: aliens to the true meaning of Scripture. As in
Independence Day, these aliens are powerful, and their protective shields seem
impenetrable. Left Behind seems like the mother ship.
In the light of history, the Protestant Reformation, and a correct understanding
of the Bible’s antichrist prophecies, in this sense only, historicism is
the good virus. Who is bold enough to upload the truth? Dear friend, an essential
component of this good virus—the biblical truth about the antichrist—
when rightly understood, will blow both preterism and futurism into a million
pieces. It may be painful, but it needs to happen for the sake of
Christians everywhere. We need another Independence Day.
Truth may be in the minority, but don’t forget, its power is limitless. In
the 1500’s, it started with individuals like Martin Luther. He studied the
Word of God and then inserted its high-voltage force into European
Christianity. Through the Holy Spirit’s power, Luther and his associates
helped dissipate the Dark Ages. The Reformation shook the world.
In the 21st century, God again wants to shake the world (see
Revelation 18:1).
He’s looking for heroes to upload His good virus.

Faith of our Fathers
Protestants there are, but Protestantism is no more.
—Alexander Vinet (1797-1847)
“The gloves are off, and the battle is launched between the forces of
good and evil for the very souls of men and women around the globe,” so says
Left Behind’s eighth book, The Mark—The Beast Rules The World (inside
cover). Unfortunately, Left Behind’s entire drama places the rise of the beast
itself, the enforcement of its deadly mark, and the final end time “battle
between the forces of good and evil” only after the rapture. It’s no secret that
this is also the teaching of these much-respected prophecy teachers: Dr. John
Walvoord, Tim LaHaye, Thomas Ice, Hal Lindsey, Jack Van Impe, John
Hagee, Arno Froese, Peter Lalonde, Chuck Smith and Grant Jeffrey. With
the utmost fairness, and without judging anyone’s heart or destiny, it is proper
to place these men in the “futurist” camp. On the “preterist” side today
(either “partial” or “full”) we have such influential leaders as Gary DeMar,
Kenneth L. Gentry, Jr., David Chilton, R.C. Sproul, Max King, James Stuart
Russell, Samuel M. Frost, and John Noe. To these scholars (generally speaking),
the beast is not on the horizon, he’s dead. When Nero breathed his last
foul breath and gave up the ghost—so much for antichrist. It is the conviction
of this writer that both preterists and futurists have unknowingly left
behind some of the Bible’s most solemn truths.
Through their acceptance of futurist and preterist viewpoints about
antichrist—in contrast to the teachings of John Wycliffe, William Tyndale,
Martin Luther, Calvin’s Institutes, the original Westminster confessors, the
translators of the King James Bible, Sir Isaac Newton, J.A. Wylie, Merle
D’Aubigne, H. Grattan Guinness, John Wesley, Matthew Henry, Albert
133
Barnes, John Bunyan, Charles H. Spurgeon, E.B. Elliott, Jonathan Edwards,
Bishop J.C. Ryle, Dr. Martin Lloyd Jones, Dr. Ian Paisley, Doug Batchelor,
Alan Campbell, Dr. Francis Nigel Lee, Mrs. M. McKinstry, Deroy L. Hanson,
Dr. Val Finnell, Mark Finley, Robert Caringola, and countless other historic
Protestants—these preterists and futurists don’t know who the real beast is. Yet
our eyes have been opened. We know the truth. It won’t be easy, but with the
Bible in our hands and God’s love in our hearts we must stand up for “the revelation
of Jesus Christ” (Revelation 1:1) and solid prophetic truth, no matter
what the cost. It is my hope and prayer that God will impress the minds of
many well-known TV evangelists, radio hosts, seminary professors, bestselling
authors, and ministry leaders (futurist, preterist, Protestant, and
Catholic) to reconsider their positions. Hopefully, like noble ships with a
new command from their captain, they will yet change their course.
As we near the end of this Antichrist Delusions section, I want to focus
on a lesson of faith and courage—of standing up for Jesus and His prophetic
truth. Turning away from futurist fiction with its imaginary Nicolae, and also
the preterist persuasion of a long-buried antichrist, we are about to look at
the real account of a man who battled the beast in history. This conflict took
place in the 1400’s, during the time of the famous Roman Catholic Council
of Constance, in Constance, Germany. The council met November 1, 1414
and continued until April 22, 1418.
“The total number of the clergy alone present at the
council, though perhaps not all of them all the time, was four
patriarchs, twenty-nine cardinals, thirty-three archbishops,
one hundred and fifty bishops, one hundred and thirty-four
abbots, two hundred and fifty doctors, and lesser clergy,
amounting to eighteen thousand. With the emperor and his
train, kings, dukes, lords, and other nobles, the members were
ordinarily fifty thousand. At certain periods of the conference
there were as many as one hundred thousand present. Thirty
thousand horses were fed, and thirty thousand beds were provided
by the city.”115
In our modern terminology we would have said, “This is a big event.
Parking is limited.”
The Council of Constance condemned the writings of John Wycliffe of
England, who lived in the 1300’s. Wycliffe taught at Oxford University and
has been called, “The Morning Star of the Reformation.” The movie, John
Wycliffe—The Morning Star, was awarded the title of Best Film from the
Christian Film Distributor’s Association. Before Martin Luther, John
Wycliffe protested against Rome, was the first to translate the Bible from
Latin into English, taught salvation by faith in Jesus Christ alone, placed the
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
134
Word of God above popes and kings, and openly declared papal Rome to be
the great antichrist of prophecy. The Council of Constance—more than forty
years after Wycliffe’s death—decreed that his decaying bones should be dug
out of his grave and publicly burned. His ashes were triumphantly thrown
into a nearby brook. “This brook,” says an old writer, “hath conveyed his
ashes into Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, they into
the main ocean. And thus the ashes of Wycliffe are the emblems of his doctrine,
which now is dispersed the world over.”116
John Huss of Bohemia read the writings of John Wycliffe and continued
many of his reforms. After denouncing Wycliffe, the Council of Constance
summoned John Huss also, condemning him to the flames. Jerome of Prague
was a good friend of Huss, and in April of 1415, before the martyrdom of
Huss, Jerome arrived at Constance, hoping to help his friend. Unfortunately,
he was seized by his enemies, cruelly dragged through the streets in chains,
and promptly thrown into a dark, miserable, rat-infested dungeon. For almost
a year, he was transferred from cell to cell. At last he was brought before the
council. Fox’s Book of Martyrs declares that before that vast assembly these
false charges were read against him: “1. He was a derider of the papal dignity.
2. An opposer of the pope. 3. An enemy to the cardinals. 4. A persecutor
of the prelates. 5. A hater of the Christian religion.”117 Jerome was commanded
to accept Romanism or be consumed at the stake.
Weakened by almost a year of horrible treatment, Jerome’s faith
wavered, and he agreed in some measure to submit to Rome. But after he was
returned to his rat-infested cell, he saw more clearly what he had done. He
thought about his friend John Huss, who perished in the flames. He thought
about Jesus Christ, his Savior, whom he had pledged to serve and who, out of
love for Jerome’s lost soul, had endured the full justice of God’s holy wrath
against sin and the incomprehensible pain of separation from His Father.
Before his cowardly decision to compromise, Jerome had found comfort amid
his sufferings in the assurance of Heaven’s favor; but now remorse and doubts
tortured his soul. He knew other compromises must be made before he would
be released, which could only end in his complete apostasy from God’s truth.
As he looked into the whiskered faces of rats and felt cockroaches crawling
around his toes, Jerome made his decision. He would no longer deny his Lord.
Jerome was brought again before the council, but this time he was determined
to boldly confess his faith and to follow his friend John Huss to the
flames. He publicly renounced his former denial and demanded, as a dying
man, an opportunity to make his defense. “You have held me shut up three
hundred and forty days in a frightful prison,” he protested, “in the midst of
filth, noisomeness, stench, and the utmost want of everything; you then
bring me out before you, and lending an ear to my mortal enemies, you refuse
to hear me…If you be really wise men and the lights of the world, take care
Faith of Our Fathers
135
not to sin against justice. As for me, I am only a feeble mortal; my life is but
of little importance.”118 His request was finally granted. In the presence of
Europe’s judges, priests, and nobles, Jerome knelt down and prayed for the
Holy Ghost to take control.
Jerome then gave an uncompromising defense in behalf of truth.
Referring to John Huss, he firmly declared, “I knew him from his childhood.
He was a most excellent man, just and holy; he was condemned, notwithstanding
his innocence…I also am ready to die. I will not recoil before the
torments that are prepared for me by my enemies and false witnesses, who
will one day have to render an account of their impostures before the great
God, whom nothing can deceive…Of all the sins that I have committed
since my youth, none weigh so heavily on my mind, and cause me such
remorse, as that which I committed in this fatal place, when I approved of
the iniquitous sentence rendered against Wycliffe, and against the holy martyr,
John Huss, my master and my friend. Yes! I confess it from my heart, and
declare with horror that I disgracefully quailed when, through a dread of
death, I condemned their doctrines. I therefore supplicate…Almighty God
to pardon me my sins, and this one in particular, the most heinous of all.”
Raising a bony finger toward his judges, he declared, “You condemned
Wycliffe and John Huss…The things which they affirmed, and which are
irrefutable, I also think and declare, like them.”119
His hearers were stunned! “Shut him up!” screamed his enemies. “What
need have we of further proof? We behold with our own eyes the most obstinate
of heretics!” Yet Jerome stood unmoved, like a mighty rock amidst a
hurricane. He thundered back, “What! Do you suppose I fear to die? You
have held me in a frightful dungeon, more horrible than death itself. You
have treated me more cruelly than a Turk, Jew, or pagan, and my flesh has literally
rotted off my bones alive, and yet I make no complaint, for lamentation
ill becomes a man of heart and spirit; but I cannot but express my astonishment
at such great barbarity toward a Christian.”120 He was seized by his
guards and hurried back to the rats, beetles, and vermin.
Jerome was again visited in his dingy cell and given one last chance
to repent. “Prove to me from the Holy Writings that I am in error!” he
responded. “The Holy Writings!” said one of his tempters. “Is everything to
be judged by them? Who can understand them until the church has interpreted
them?” Jerome replied, “Are the traditions of men more worthy of
faith than the gospel of our Savior?” “Heretic!” spat back his accuser, “I
repent having pleaded so long with you. I see you are urged on by the
devil.”121 Thus Jerome, even though he was accused of being inspired by
satan, refused to bow down to the traditions of mere mortals. “The Bible
and the Bible only,” was his motto. This lesson is for us. We also may be
accused of being lucifer-led when we turn from preterist persuasions, futur-
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
136
ist fables, and bestselling ideas. Nevertheless, with love in our hearts we
should stick to “the Holy Writings,” no matter what the cost.
Sentence was passed, and Jerome was led out to the very same spot
were John Huss had yielded up his life. He went singing on his way, his face
lighted up with joy and peace. His gaze was fixed upon Jesus Christ, the
Prince of Life, so why should he fear Dr. Death? Arriving at the place of execution,
Jerome once more knelt down to say a heartfelt prayer. He was tied
to a stake as branches of wood were piled around his feet. When the executioner
stepped up to light the fire, this holy martyr exclaimed, “Come here,
and kindle it before my eyes; for if I had been afraid of it, I had not come to
this place.”122 As the flames began to rise, Jerome prayed again. His last
words were, “Lord, Almighty Father…have pity on me, and pardon my sins;
for Thou knowest I have always loved Thy truth.”123
Do we love truth above tradition? Are we willing to stand up for Jesus
Christ, the Author of Truth, and for the Holy Bible, no matter what the
price may be? Dear reader, Jesus loves you personally. He has a special place
in His heart for you and your family. He gave Jerome strength to stand up
for what he knew to be right, and He will do the same for us. There is forgiveness
only through the blood of the Lamb. Satan and mixed-up men
may kill the body, but they can’t harm the soul (see Matthew 10:28).
Though the beast makes “war with the saints and overcomes them” on
Earth (Revelation 13:7), in Heaven’s eyes “they overcame him by the blood
of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, [as] they did not love their
lives to the death” (Revelation 12:11).
In our modern world of Delta flights, plasma screen TVs, and heavilytraded
mutual funds, may our hopes still echo the words of the classic 19thcentury
hymn, “Faith of Our Fathers”:
Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free;
How sweet would be their children’s fate,
If they like them, could die for thee!
Faith of our fathers! Holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

ISRAEL DELUSIONS

Chapter 22
All Eyes on Israel
All truth passes through three stages. First, it is
ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is
accepted as being self-evident.
— Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)
After much hype, when the world’s clocks finally ticked over to 12:01
a.m. and the dreaded year 2000 A.D., it became obvious that Y2K doomsday
prophecies had failed. Earnest predictions about massive computer chaos,
power disruptions, bank failures, stock markets crashing, nuclear missiles
launching, and the resulting global terror, all proved to be false prophecies.
Is it possible that certain popular end time predictions about Israel will also fail?
On that same New Year’s Eve in 1999, Israeli police assembled in
record numbers inside Jerusalem. They were determined to keep the peace
in the midst of growing concerns about terrorism and the possible explosive
actions of religious fanatics. Thousands of pilgrims and worshippers were
crowding toward the Temple Mount and the Wailing Wall as news
reporters from around the globe swarmed throughout the City of David.
With the approach of the long expected new millennium, apocalyptic
interest was at its height. Countless Christians were thinking, If the arrival
of the year 2000 has anything to do with prophecy and the end of the world, then
surely Jerusalem is the place to watch!
Yet nothing happened.
Why are the eyes of so many people fixed upon Jerusalem? There are
many reasons, yet one big one is clear. The fact is, literally millions of
Christians who study prophecy firmly believe Planet Earth’s final events will
141
one day swirl around the Middle East, Jerusalem, and the Jews. According to
what is commonly understood, what happens to the modern nation of Israel
is definitely connected with an upcoming bloody battle of Armageddon, the
return of Jesus Christ, and the end of the age.
Here’s just a few examples illustrating this current Israel-and-the-end
connection:
1. The Christian movie, The Omega Code (1999), which
grossed $2.4 million in its opening weekend, firmly
connects the Bible’s end time prophecies with a rebuilt
temple in Jerusalem.
2. Left Behind: The Movie (2001) also connects Jerusalem
with end-of-the-world events. It opens with a surprise
Russian attack on Israel.
3. The September 1, 1999 issue of Newsweek, focusing on
millennial issues and Bible prophecy, reported, “…the
predominant issue in Christian prophecy is the return of
the Jews to the Holy Land and the rebuilding of the
Jerusalem temple.”124 “… for true believers, ground zero
for apocalyptic zealotry remains the city of Jerusalem.”125
4. Time magazine, July 1, 2002, commenting on apocalyptic
theories reported: “Israel [is]…the land where events must
unfold in a specific way for Jesus to return.”126
5. Newsweek, June 2, 2003: “Many…evangelicals believe
that Jesus won’t return until the Jewish state is fully
re-established, including Jerusalem.”127
The list is endless…
It may sound like blasphemy to some, but the purpose of this highly
explosive section of End Time Delusions is to reexamine the accuracy of these
current teachings, especially in the light of Jesus Christ, of the New
Testament, and the Book of Revelation.
In our journey, we will answer these core questions: What did the
Master mean when He said of Nathaniel, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in
whom is no deceit!” (John 1:47, emphasis added)? What did Paul have in
mind when he wrote, “They are not all Israel who are of Israel” (Romans
9:6)? Why does the New Testament refer to two Israels—an “Israel after the
flesh” (1 Corinthians 10:18) and “the Israel of God” (Galatians 6:14-16) in
Jesus Christ? Finally, what is the true meaning of Revelation’s mysterious
prophecies about 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel, Mystery Babylon, the
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
142
Euphrates River running dry, and Armageddon, “the battle of that great day
of God Almighty” (Revelation 7:4; 16:13-16; 17:5)?
Before we go any further, I want to remind you what I revealed in the
Preface of this book. I’m Jewish, and I love Jewish people. Many of my relatives
are Jewish, but sadly, most do not believe the good news of Jesus Christ.
They don’t realize Jesus Himself lived a perfect Jewish life and that His death
fulfilled ancient Hebrew prophecies about the birth, sinless life, suffering,
death, and resurrection of a Jewish Messiah (see Micah 5:2 and Isaiah 53).
Like Paul, “my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be
saved” (Romans 10:1).
But here’s the key. In the midst of my love for Jewish people and
Israel, I am also a student of prophecy, and in my research, I have come to
a frightening conclusion. In the midst of popular prophetic theories about
the modern Israeli nation, the war-torn city of Jerusalem and Armageddon,
I’m convinced there are some gigantic errors—Israel Delusions—being
taught worldwide which are not in harmony with the exact words of Jesus
Christ or the true meaning of the Book of Revelation. To His Jewish disciples,
our Lord warned, “Take heed that no one deceives you” (Matthew
24:4). As a Jewish believer, I have taken this warning seriously.
Y2K prophecies failed. No terrorist explosions took place in Jerusalem
on the eve of the new millennium.
You are about to discover solid New Testament proof that many 21st
century Christian predictions about modern Israel will also fail. Yet God’s
Word will be fulfilled.
This label is appropriate here, “Warning: Handle with Prayer!”

Chapter 23
Wrestling With an Angel
Humility, that low, sweet root, from which all heavenly
virtues shoot.
— Thomas Moore (1779-1852)
Have you ever heard of a wrestling match between a human being and
an angel? As far as we know, it happened only once in history. The details of
this ancient story will soon take on explosive significance in our study of
Israel and Bible prophecy.
Abraham lived about 4,000 years ago. He had a son named Isaac who had
a son named Jacob. It was Jacob who wrestled with the angel, and as a result,
the angel changed Jacob’s name to “Israel.” In order to understand this strange
encounter and its deep meaning for us today, we must study some history about
Isaac, Rebekah, Esau, and Jacob as recorded in Genesis 27.
“When Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see,”
he decided to bless Esau, his firstborn son, before he died (Genesis 27:1-4).
But first he sent Esau out to the field to hunt for his favorite meal. Isaac’s
wife, Rebekah, had other plans. Realizing the importance of her husband’s
blessing upon the firstborn, she coveted that blessing for her younger son,
Jacob, who was more spiritual than Esau. While Esau was out hunting in the
field, Rebekah quickly prepared a meal and convinced Jacob to take the food
to Isaac while pretending to be Esau (see Genesis 27:5-17).
When Jacob brought the dish to his father, he lied, saying, “I am Esau
your firstborn; I have done just as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of
my game, that your soul may bless me” (verse 19). When Isaac inquired
how he had killed an animal so quickly, Jacob lied again, saying, “Because
145
the Lord your God brought it to me” (verse 20). Suspiciously, Isaac asked,
“Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob lied a third time, saying, “I am” (verse
24). Isaac finally believed Jacob’s deception and gave him the blessing (see
verses 25-29).
Soon afterward Esau returned from the hunt and Isaac realized he’d
been tricked. “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your
blessing” (verse 35), the father said to his older son. Then “Esau hated
Jacob” and said in his heart, “I will kill my brother Jacob” (verse 41).
Rebekah discovered Esau’s plot and sent Jacob away to her relatives in a far
country, where he remained for 20 years (see Genesis 27:43; 31:41). Jacob
never saw his mother’s face again.
Twenty years later Jacob headed home. Surrounded by a large caravan
of family and servants, he sent messengers ahead of the group to tell Esau he
was coming. But the men returned with the news that Esau and 400 soldiers
were on their way to meet him. Fear gripped Jacob’s heart. He felt a deep
sense of guilt over his past sin of deception and was terrified for the safety of
his family. So Jacob “arose that night” and “was left alone” to plead with God
for forgiveness and deliverance (Genesis 32:22,24).
Then “a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day” (verse 24).
This Man was really “the Angel” (Hosea 12:4). Unaware of this, and
assuming this must be his still-angry brother Esau, Jacob struggled all night
for his life. At the crack of dawn, this powerful Stranger revealed Himself,
not as a foe, but as a heavenly Friend. He touched Jacob’s hip, “and the
socket of Jacob’s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him” (verse 25).
Jacob suddenly realized this powerful Being was now his only hope.
Broken and helpless, he clung to the Messenger, saying, “I will not let You go
unless You bless me!”
The Angel then asked, “What is your name?”
“And he said, ‘Jacob.’ ”
“And He said, ‘Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel;
for you have struggled with God and with men, and have prevailed’ ”
(verses 26-28, emphasis added).
This is the first time the word “Israel” is used in the Bible, and the context
reveals its deep spiritual significance. In the beginning, “Israel” was a
special name given to only one man, to Jacob, by the Angel of God. In the
Bible, people’s names mean more than they do today. Back then, names were
often descriptions of people’s characters.
Jacob literally meant, “deceiver,” or “crook.” When Esau discovered
Jacob’s sin of deception, he said to Isaac, “Is he not rightly named Jacob?”
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
146
(Genesis 27:36) Thus the name, “Jacob,” was a description of his character
and of his sin. When the Angel said, “What is your name?” He knew the
answer. But He wanted Jacob to say his own name, which represented a humble
confession and turning away from his sin. Jacob passed the test, repented,
and placed his entire dependence upon God’s love and mercy.
The response, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel,”
revealed that God had given him a new character. According to the margin
of the New King James Bible, the word “Israel” literally means, “Prince
with God.” Thus the name “Israel” itself was a spiritual name, symbolizing
Jacob’s spiritual victory over his past sin of deception. In other words, the
man “Jacob” was now a spiritual “Israel.” As we shall see, this truth about
a spiritual Israel will take on explosive significance in our study of Israel
and Bible prophecy.
Israel had 12 sons “who came to Egypt” (Exodus 1:1-5). One son,
named Joseph, had dreams (see Genesis 37). Remember this, for we will
come back to it. The children of Israel multiplied in Egypt and were forced
into slavery until the time of Moses. Then God told Moses, “Say to Pharaoh,
‘Thus says the Lord: “Israel is My son, My firstborn….Let My son go” ’ ”
(Exodus 4:22-23). Here’s an important development in biblical thought. The
name “Israel” is now being expanded. It no longer refers only to Jacob, but
also to his descendants. The nation is now “Israel.” Thus, “Israel” first applied
to a victorious man, then a people. It was God’s desire that this new nation
of Israel should also be victorious, as was Jacob, through faith in Him. God
called this new nation “My son, My firstborn.” Remember this also. It will
become important shortly.
The next paragraph below contains little phrases about Israel which
may seem dry at first, but amazing things can happen when you water a dry
seed. Those little phrases will soon sprout into trees of towering significance
when we turn to the New Testament. Take special note of them.
Israel was “a vine” God brought “out of Egypt” (Psalm 80:8). God
said, “But thou, Israel, art My servant…the seed of Abraham” (Isaiah 41:8
KJV). God also spoke of “Israel My elect” (Isaiah 45:4). Again, God said
through Isaiah, “Behold! My Servant whom I uphold, My Elect One in
whom My soul delights! I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring
forth justice to the Gentiles. He will not cry out, nor raise His voice, nor
cause His voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed He will not break,
and smoking flax He will not quench; He will bring forth justice for truth”
(Isaiah 42:1-3). All of these words originally applied to the physical nation
of Israel. Don’t forget this.
In about 800 B.C., the Lord said through the prophet Hosea,
“When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son”
Wrestling With an Angel
147
(Hosea 11:1). Yet by this time, Israel had failed to live up to the meaning
of her own name. She had not lived victoriously, as a “Prince with
God.” The Lord sadly declared, “They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned
incense to carved images” (Hosea 11:2). Yet God had a special plan.
That small, solitary sentence, “When Israel was a child, I loved him, and
out of Egypt I called My son,” is actually like a tiny bomb that will soon
explode with tremendous importance as we turn to the New Testament.

Chapter 24
A New Look at Jesus Christ
The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new
landscapes but in having new eyes.
— Marcel Proust (1871-1922)
Approximately 800 years had passed since the time of Hosea the
prophet. Finally, Heaven’s prophetic clock struck twelve. “Jesus was born in
Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king” (Matthew 2:1). Because
King Herod felt threatened by this newly born potential rival to his throne,
he sent soldiers who cruelly “put to death all the male children who were in
Bethlehem” (Matthew 2:16). Yet God warned Joseph in advance of the
slaughter. “Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying,
‘Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay
there until I bring you word” (verse 13). So the family arose and “departed
for Egypt” (verse 14).
The next sentence after Matthew 2:14 is almost unbelievable in its
prophetic implications. Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Matthew
wrote that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus remained in Egypt “until the death of
Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
saying, ‘Out of Egypt have I called my son’ ” (verse 15, KJV, emphasis added).
Do you realize what you just read? Matthew is quoting Hosea 11:1 which,
in its historical context, referred to the nation of Israel being called out of
Egypt in the time of Moses. Yet here the very first Gospel writer picks up this
text and declares it “fulfilled” in Jesus Christ! Here Matthew is beginning to
reveal a principle he develops throughout his book. Paul also taught the same
principle, as we shall see.
149
Remember, the first time the name “Israel” is used in the Bible, it was
a spiritual name given to one man, to Jacob (see Genesis 32:28). That
name had to do with Jacob’s spiritual victory. It meant, “Prince with God.”
Even so in the beginning of the New Testament that same name is beginning
to be applied to one Man, to the Victorious One, to Jesus Christ, the
Prince of God.
There are amazing parallels between the history of Israel and the history
of Jesus Christ. In Hebrew history, a young man named Joseph had dreams
and went to Egypt (see Genesis 37,39). In the New Testament we find another
Joseph who had dreams and went to Egypt (see Matthew 2). In Hebrew
history, when God called Israel out of Egypt, He called that new nation “My
son” (Exodus 4:22). When Jesus came out of Egypt, God said, “Out of Egypt
I called My Son” (Matthew 2:15). When Israel left Egypt, the people went
through the Red Sea. They were “baptized…in the sea” (1 Corinthians 10:2).
In the third chapter of Matthew, we read that Jesus was baptized in the Jordan
“to fulfill all righteousness” (verse 15). Then God called Jesus, His “beloved
Son” (verse 17).
After the Israelites passed through the Red Sea, they spent 40 years in
the wilderness. Immediately after Jesus was baptized in the Jordan, He was
“led up by the Spirit into the wilderness” for 40 days (Matthew 4:1-2). At the
end of those 40 days, Jesus resisted the devil’s tricky temptations by quoting
three key Scriptures. All were from Deuteronomy, the very book God gave
Israel during her 40-year sojourn in the wilderness! What does this mean? It
means that in Matthew’s book, Jesus was repeating the history of Israel, point
by point, and was overcoming where they had failed. In other words, Christ
was showing Himself to be the primary Israel, the Prince of God; the
Victorious One who overcomes all sin.
After healing large numbers of people, Jesus “warned them not to make
Him known, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
prophet, saying: ‘Behold! My Servant, whom I have chosen, My Beloved in
whom My soul is well pleased! I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will
declare justice to the Gentiles. He will not quarrel nor cry out, nor will anyone
hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed He will not break, and
smoking flax He will not quench, till He sends forth justice to victory’ ”
(Matthew 12:16-20).
Here Matthew is doing the same thing he did with Hosea 11:1. He is
quoting Isaiah 42:1-3, which, in its original context, referred to God’s “servant,”
which was “Israel…My Servant” (Isaiah 41:8). Once again, under
inspiration from the Holy Spirit, the first writer in the New Testament said
that Isaiah 42:1-3 was being “fulfilled” by God’s “servant,” Jesus Christ.

What about those other seemingly dry little phrases about the nation of
Israel? It’s time to water them, too. They must now grow into trees that reach
Heaven. In Psalm 80:8, Israel was called a “vine.” Yet Jesus Christ declared,
“I am the true vine” (John 15:1). God referred to the nation of Israel as “My
son, My firstborn” (Exodus 4:22). Yet Paul later called our Messiah “the firstborn
over all creation” (Colossians 1:15). The prophet Isaiah clearly called
Israel, “the seed of Abraham” (Isaiah 41:8 KJV). Yet Paul wrote, “Now to
Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, ‘And to
seeds,’ as of many, but as of one, ‘And to your Seed,’ who is Christ”
(Galatians 3:16).
That last text is the clearest and most explosive of them all! In the Old
Testament, God definitely called “Israel…the seed of Abraham” (Isaiah 41:8
KJV). In Galatians 3:16, Paul plainly wrote that Abraham’s seed does not refer
to “many,” but to “one…who is Christ.” What does this mean? It means that
when Paul looked back—just like Matthew did—at Old Testament statements
about “Israel” he saw them as inherently foreshadowing the coming
Messiah, Jesus Christ. To Paul, the Messiah is the “Seed.” Jesus Christ is the
perfect Israel!
Yet there’s more. In Genesis and Exodus, the name “Israel” not only
referred to one victorious man, to Jacob, but also to his descendants, who
became Israel. The same principle is revealed in the New Testament. Right
after calling Jesus the “Seed,” Paul told his Gentile converts, “And if you are
Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed” (Galatians 3:29). Thus in the New
Testament, the name Israel not only applies to the one Victorious Man, the
true Seed, Jesus Christ, but also to those who belong to Christ. Believers in
Jesus are infused into the “Seed.” In other words, true Christians are part of
God’s spiritual Israel.
These fundamental New Testament facts will soon take on explosive
significance when we examine what the Book of Revelation really teaches
about Israel, Babylon the Great, and Armageddon.

Chapter 25
Clarity Through Double Vision
Beware of the half truth. You may have gotten hold of
the wrong half.
— Author Unknown
Have you ever been hit so hard on the head you started seeing double?
From what I have studied, the Christian world needs a compassionate bonk
on the head with the truth of the New Testament. Then more Christians
would start seeing double about the subject of Israel. According to Paul, there
are two Israels. The proof? The Jewish apostle wrote, “They are not all Israel
who are of Israel” (Romans 9:6). In this chapter, we will discover that there
is an “Israel after the flesh” (1 Corinthians 10:18) and an “Israel of God”
(Galatians 6:16), composed of both Jews and Gentiles who have personal
faith in Jesus Christ, God’s true Messiah.
Paul wrote, “Just as Abraham ‘believed God, and it was accounted to
him for righteousness.’ Therefore know that only those who are of faith are
sons of Abraham” (Galatians 3:6-7). Paul’s argument is that because
Abraham was a man of faith, only those who have faith are his spiritual children.
We might call this the concept of “faith lineage.” This truth is like a
key that can open a lock in our heads. Once the lock is open we can understand
the shocking principle of two Israels.
John the Baptist understood and boldly preached “faith lineage.” When
a group of tricky Pharisees and Sadducees came to question John’s right to
baptize, the wilderness prophet astonished them by shouting, “And do not
think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you
that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. And even
153
now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not
bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire” (Matthew 3:9-10).
Those Pharisees and Sadducees didn’t have real faith like Abraham did,
yet they claimed to be his children. John the Baptist exposed this delusion.
“Don’t think that!” he thundered. John then laid the “ax” to the root of the
trees by saying that if they didn’t bear “good fruit” through faith in God like
Abraham did, they would be “cut down and thrown into the fire” (verse 10).
Clearly natural lineage alone is not enough. Without faith and a spiritual
connection with the Almighty, those Jews were doomed.
Jesus Christ taught the same truth. A certain group of Jewish people once
said to Him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus responded, “If you were Abraham’s
children, you would do the works of Abraham” (John 8:39). They also claimed
to be Abraham’s children, but they lacked true faith. By saying, “If you were
Abraham’s children,” Jesus denied their claim. Christ continued, “But now you
seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God.
Abraham did not do this. You do the deeds of your father” (John 8:40-41).
“We have one Father—God,” they countered. “Jesus said to them, ‘If
God were your Father, you would love Me…You are of your father the devil,
and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for he is a liar and
the father of it’ ” (John 8:41-42,44).
What an atomic text! Jesus was talking to some Jewish people who
claimed to be Israelites, the children of Abraham, yet they were only following
God outwardly, not in heart. Jesus said they weren’t really Abraham’s
children at all because they lacked true faith and were following lies. Their
lineage actually went back to satan, the first liar. Soon we will separate God’s
truth from satan’s lies when we look at what Revelation really teaches about
Israel, the 144,000, Mystery Babylon, and Armageddon.
Jesus Christ also taught “faith lineage” in John chapter 1. A spirituallyminded
Jew named Nathanael was wondering whether Jesus of Nazareth was
really his Messiah. Retiring to a favorite spot under a fig tree, he prayed about
the matter. Soon a friend introduced him to the Savior. When Jesus saw
Nathanael, He joyfully declared, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
deceit!” (John 1:47)
Nathanael had a natural lineage that went back to Abraham. Yet he
had more. In his spiritual life, he had gained victories over guile, which
means deception. When Jesus discerned Nathanael’s spiritual lineage to
Abraham and Jacob, He called him “an Israelite indeed.” Just as Jacob
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
154
himself had become a spiritual Israel, even so had Nathanael become “an
Israelite indeed.” He was part of God’s true spiritual Israel.
Just as there are two Israels, even so are there two kinds of Jews.
There are Jewish people in the flesh and Jewish people in the Spirit. In
words of warning to certain Jews who were breaking the Ten
Commandments, Paul wrote, “Indeed you are called a Jew, and rest on the
law, and make your boast in God….For circumcision is indeed profitable
if you keep the law; but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision
has become uncircumcision. Therefore, if an uncircumcised man [a
Gentile] keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision
be counted as circumcision?…For he is not a Jew who is one
outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh; but he
is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God”
(Romans 2:17,25-26,28-29).
Did you catch that? Someone who is “called a Jew” because he is a physical
descendant of Abraham, and yet who lives as a lawbreaker, is “not a Jew.”
His “circumcision has become uncircumcision.” To God, he is a Gentile.
And the believing Gentile, who through faith keeps “the righteous requirements
of the law,” his uncircumcision is “counted as circumcision.” To God,
he is a Jew. Thus John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, and Paul all agree—natural
lineage is not enough. Whether or not someone is “an Israelite indeed”
depends upon one’s faith and spiritual character. Paul summarized, “For we
are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus,
and have no confidence in the flesh” (Philippians 3:3). Anyone today can
become one of these “Jews,” no matter who their earthly parents are.
These concepts of “faith lineage,” Jews being counted as Gentiles, and
visa versa, lead us to one of the biggest issues facing the prophecy-minded
Christian world. This issue is at the core of prophetic interpretation. In it, we
are faced with two options. One is the truth, the other a lie. One leads to
Heaven and the other, possibly, to hell.
The big question is, “What about the promises God made to Israel in
the Old Testament?” If we conclude those promises must be fulfilled to
“Israel after the flesh” (1 Corinthians 10:18) then we must conclude that
Jerusalem and the modern Jewish nation will eventually become the epicenter
of the final battle of Armageddon. But if we conclude that those
promises can legitimately be fulfilled to God’s Israel in the Spirit, then we
must restudy the Book of Revelation to discover how its end time prophecies
apply to true Christians—Jewish or Gentile—who love Jesus the
Messiah with all their hearts.
Clarity Through Double Vision
155
Paul deals with this explosive issue in Romans 9:2-8. His words require
careful thought. Sorrowfully, Paul wrote about his Jewish “countrymen
according to the flesh, who are Israelites, to whom pertain the adoption,
the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the
promises” (verses 2-4). God did make promises to Israel in the Old
Testament. Yet what if some Jews do not have true faith in Him? Can God
fulfill His promises to an unbelieving Israel after the flesh? If not, has His
Word failed?
Paul’s answer to these important questions is vital: “Not that the word
of God has taken no effect. For they are not all Israel who are of Israel” (verse
6). Notice that the truth of two Israels is Paul’s assurance that God’s Word
will not fail. Look carefully: “They are not all Israel [the Israel of God] who
are of Israel [of the Jewish nation].” Thus a Jew can be of the Jewish nation,
and yet not be part of the Israel of God. Now here’s the explosive question:
To which Israel will God fulfill His promises?
Paul continues, “Nor are they all children because they are the seed of
Abraham; but, ‘In Isaac your seed shall be called’ ” (verse 7). Since not all
physical descendants of Abraham are automatically God’s true children,
therefore His promises are for those “in Isaac.” Abraham had two sons. The
first was Ishmael, who was born after the flesh. The second was Isaac, who
was born when Abraham had faith in God’s promise (see Genesis 16:1-3,15;
21:1-3; Romans 4:18-21). In Galatians 4:22-31, Paul shockingly reveals that
Ishmael represents unbelieving Jews, while Isaac represents Jews and Gentiles
who have faith in Christ! “Now we, brethren [as believers in Christ], as Isaac
was, are children of promise” (Galatians 4:28). The “children of promise” are
those who “receive the promise of the Spirit through faith” (Galatians 3:14).
Therefore, the Israel that is “in Isaac” is the Israel of God in the Holy Spirit.
Paul concludes, “That is, those who are the children of the flesh, these are
not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as the
seed” (Romans 9:8, emphasis added). “Counted as the seed” means that,
although some may be Gentiles, they’re in.
Here is an eight-point summary of Paul’s rather detailed reasoning:
1. God made promises to Abraham and his seed
(Galatians 3:16).
2. Abraham’s seed would continue “in Isaac” (Romans 9:7).
3. Isaac was born when Abraham had faith in God’s promise
(Romans 4:19-21).
4. Isaac represents everyone who believes in Jesus and who
receives the promise of the Holy Spirit by faith (Galatians
3:14; 4:22-28)
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
156
5. All who have faith in Jesus Christ—Jews or Gentiles—“are
counted as the seed” (Galatians 3:14; Romans 9:8; 10:12).
6. This seed is “the Israel of God” in Jesus Christ
(Galatians 3:16,29; 6:14-16).
7. God will fulfill His promises to this Israel (Galatians 3:29;
4:28; 6:14-16).
8. Thus God’s promises to Israel have not been made of “no
effect,” even though some Jewish people don’t believe in
their own Messiah (Romans 9:6-8).
Here we have the answer to the issue that means so much in
prophetic interpretation. The Bible is clear. God will fulfill His Old
Testament promises to those “in Isaac,” that is, to any human being who
follows Abraham’s example and who becomes part of His Israel in the
Spirit through faith in the Messiah. Thus the issue is not race, bloodline,
genealogy, or ethnicity, but personal faith—a faith available to all (see
Romans 10:12). Those who are only “the children of the flesh, these are
not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as
the seed” (Romans 9:8). We should not expect God to fulfill His promises
to unbelieving Israelites of the flesh (or to lips-only Christians of the
flesh for that matter), unless, of course, they individually become true
believers in the Messiah.
Let’s look at one more controversial section before we close this
chapter. What about Paul’s question, “Has God cast away His people?”
(Romans 11:1). These words are being quoted around the world to prove
that God has not cast away any Israelites of the flesh. How can we explain
this? First of all, the same chapter does describe “the casting away” of some
Jewish people who don’t believe (verse 15). Second, notice Paul’s answer
to his own question: “Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed
of Abraham.” Thus Paul uses himself as an example to prove that God has
not “cast away His people.” Who are “His people”?
In the next three verses, Paul refers to Israel’s apostasy in the days of
Elijah. God told His prophet, “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand
men who have not bowed the knee to Baal” (verse 4). In Elijah’s time
there were also two Israels. One followed Baal, the other followed God.
Then Paul made this pointed application. “Even so then, at this present
time there is a remnant according to the election of grace” (verse 5). Just
as in Elijah’s time there was a faithful remnant of Israel, even so in Paul’s
time there was also a faithful remnant of believing Jews, who, like himself,
had been saved by grace. Based on the context of Romans 11:1-5, it
Clarity Through Double Vision
157
is this faithful remnant of Israel, made up of Jews like Paul, which God
has certainly not “cast away.”
Soon we will see this exact issue in the Book of Revelation. As in the
days of Elijah, we are now in the midst of a terrible apostasy. Yet today God
has His “seven thousand” who have not “bowed the knee to Baal.” They are
His faithful remnant, His Israel in the Holy Spirit, who rely on God’s power
instead of their flesh. Like Elijah, they will be on the side of Jesus Christ and
His truth at Armageddon.

Chapter 26
Choice and the Chosen Nation
Man has no choice but to choose.
— Jean Paul Sartre (1905-1980)
From the summit of Mount Sinai, God Almighty thundered to Moses:
“Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: ‘You
have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings
and brought you to Myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice
and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all
people; for all the earth is Mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests
and a holy nation’ ” (Exodus 19:3-6, emphasis added).
Notice the words “if” and “then.” God said “if” Israel obeyed, “then”
they would be His special treasure. That tiny word “if” involves a big issue.
It concerns conditions. God loved Israel, and chose her apart from any
obedience on her part. He brought the people out of Egypt, bore them on
eagles’ wings, and brought them to Himself. Yet, contrary to popular opinion,
God’s use of “if” made it clear that the continuation of His favor to the
Israelites was conditional upon their response to His goodness, upon their
choices to obey (see also 1 Samuel 2:30; Jeremiah 18:7-10). In other
words, those of the chosen nation must themselves choose correctly, or the
consequences would be disastrous.
Forty years later, Israel entered the promised land and remained there for
about 800 years. During this period, many responded to God’s love by obeying
His voice. But the majority strayed from the path of righteousness. Again and
again, God manifested His mercy by sending prophets and pleading with Israel
to return to His covenant. Yet apostasy continued and deepened. Finally, after
hundreds of years of warning, disaster struck. In 722 B.C., the northern tribes
159
were carried away by the cruel Assyrians. In 586 B.C., Judah was taken to
Babylon. Such was the result of wrong choices.
In 586 B.C., the armies of Babylon demolished Jerusalem and burned its
temple with fire. The Jews were removed from their land and carried into captivity.
Yet, in the mercy of God, this exile was not to be permanent. The
prophet Jeremiah predicted that God “would accomplish seventy years in the
desolations of Jerusalem” (Daniel 9:2). After 70 years the Jews would leave
Babylon, return to their land, and rebuild their temple and their city. God was
giving His chosen nation another chance to respond to His love. In simple
terms, the Lord was saying: “You blew it. Let’s try again!”
This new opportunity is revealed in the prophecy of the “seventy
weeks,” which we examined earlier in this book. Previously, we studied
this highly controversial day-for-a-year (see Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6)
period in the context of the “seven-year tribulation” theory. Now it’s time
to approach this period again, but in a different light. We will view it in
relation to the ongoing favor of God toward Israel as a nation.
Near the end of the Babylonian captivity, Gabriel told Daniel, “Seventy
weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city, to finish the
transgression, to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, to
bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to
anoint the Most Holy” (Daniel 9:24). This 70-week period (490 years) was
“determined” for Daniel’s people, the Jews. During that period, the chosen
nation would have another chance “to finish the transgression” and “to make
an end of sins.” Near the end of that period, something big would happen.
The Messiah would come “to bring in everlasting righteousness.” As we shall
soon see, Israel’s status as a special nation under divine favor would then be
determined by her choice to receive or reject that Messiah.
Gabriel told Daniel when the seventy weeks would begin, “Know therefore
and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and
to build Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks
and sixty-two weeks” (Daniel 9:25).
Persia conquered Babylon in 538 B.C. Then King Cyrus issued a decree
for the Jews to return to their land and to rebuild their temple (see Ezra 1:1-
3). Later, King Darius issued another decree that led to the completion of the
temple (see Ezra 6:1,8). Still later, King Artaxerxes gave Nehemiah permission
to rebuild the wall around the city (see Nehemiah 1:3; 2:1-9). Yet the
predicted “command to restore and to build Jerusalem” did not occur until
King Artaxerxes issued a lengthy decree giving Ezra official authority to “set
magistrates and judges” over Jerusalem and to “execute judgment” upon all
who refused to follow the laws of God and the king (Ezra 7:21,25-26). Of the
four options to consider as a starting point for the 70-week prophecy, this was
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
160
the only decree which fully restored civil authority to Jerusalem and the
Jewish state.
That commandment occurred “in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes”
(Ezra 7:7), which was 457 B.C. This date—457 B.C.—is listed in the margin of
Ezra 7 in many modern Bibles and has also been confirmed by the widely
acclaimed Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties (Zondervan, 1982) as the starting
point of the 70-week prophecy.128 Gabriel said, “From the going forth of the
command to restore and to build Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince there
shall be seven weeks [49 years] and sixty-two weeks [434 years]” (Daniel 9:25).
7 weeks (49 years) + 62 weeks (434 years) = 69 weeks (483 years).
Going forward 483 years from 457 B.C. comes to A.D. 27, the time of
“the Messiah the Prince” (Daniel 9:25). The word “Messiah” means
“Anointed One.” In A.D. 27—the exact year specified in Daniel’s
prophecy129—Jesus Christ was “anointed” by the Holy Spirit at His baptism
(see Matthew 3:16-17; Acts 10:38) which officially marked the beginning of
His public ministry. Right after His baptism Jesus declared, “The time is fulfilled,
and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel”
(Mark 1:15, emphasis added). Christ’s words, “The time is fulfilled,” can apply
to no other time prophecy except Daniel 9! Jesus knew He was fulfilling that
ancient prediction.
7 weeks (49 years) + 62 weeks (434 years) + 1 week (7 years) = 70
weeks (490 years).
We have previously seen that during the final 70th week (from 27 to 34
A.D.), Jesus Himself “confirm[ed] the [new] covenant” (Daniel 9:27, KJV). He
did this personally during the first 3 1/2 years, and then during the second 3
1/2 years He “confirmed” His word through His disciples as they preached
mainly to Jews (see Mark 16:20; Hebrews 2:3-4). In the “midst” of the last
seven years (in 31 A.D.), when “His hour had come” (John 13:1), the ultimate
confirmation came when Jesus caused “the sacrifice… to cease” (Daniel
9:27, KJV) through His painful death on the cross.
Here’s the big question: What was the true significance of these events
to Israel’s status as God’s chosen nation? The answer can only come through
a careful study of the closing scenes of our Messiah’s life before His feet were
spiked to a tree.
Choice and the Chosen Nation

Chapter 27
Calvary and the Divine Divorce
He saw the city and wept over it.
— Luke 19:41
“Then came Peter to Him, and said, ‘Lord, how often shall my brother
sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?’ Jesus said to him, ‘I do
not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven’ ” (Matthew
18:21-22). Christ’s response to Peter’s question is quite interesting. While He
obviously was not saying that human forgiveness toward offenders should
have a limit, “seventy times seven” equals 490, which just might have been
a subtle reference to the 70-week prophecy of Daniel 9!
As we have seen, the 70-week period represented another opportunity
for the chosen nation to demonstrate faithfulness to God. Israel’s first temple
had been destroyed and her children carried to Babylon because she had
rejected God’s warnings through His prophets. Yet through divine love and
mercy, another opportunity was granted her “to finish the transgression, to
make an end of sins” (Daniel 9:24). Israel returned to her land and built a
second temple.
Though Israel had sinned more than “seven times,” God’s forgiveness
toward the nation was extended to “seventy times seven.” Near the close of
this period, One greater than the prophets would come. Then Israel’s destiny
as a nation would be determined by her response to God’s Son.
Near the end of our Messiah’s earthly life, He beheld Jerusalem “and
wept over it, saying, ‘If you had known, even you, especially in this your day,
the things that make for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment
163
around you, surround you and close you in on every side, and level you, and
your children within you, to the ground; and they will not leave in you one
stone upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation’ ”
(Luke 19:41-44).
When Jesus spoke to Peter about forgiveness being extended “until seventy
times seven,” He knew the 70-week prophecy was soon to end. He also
knew its awful significance to Israel as a nation, to Jerusalem, and to its second
temple. Chapters 21–23 of Matthew reveal the sad, final, and explosive
encounters between Jesus Christ and the leaders of His chosen people. It’s
now time to see the true meaning of those encounters.
During the week before His crucifixion, Jesus “went into the temple of
God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned
the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold
doves. And He said to them, ‘It is written, “My house shall be called a house
of prayer,” but you have made it a “den of thieves” ’ ” (Matthew 21:12-13).
At this point, Jesus still called the second temple, “My house.” But a change
would come.
“In the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry. And seeing
a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and
said to it, ‘Let no fruit grow on you ever again.’ Immediately the fig tree withered
away” (verses 18-19). Here the fig tree was a symbol of the Jewish
nation. The “seventy times seven” countdown was nearing its close.
“When He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the
people confronted Him as He was teaching” (verse 23). Their plan was to
expose the humble Nazarene as a false Messiah and have Him put to death.
Jesus then told those leaders a parable that outlined the entire history of
Israel in one panoramic sweep, culminating with their murderous designs.
There was a certain landowner [God] who planted a vineyard
[Israel] and set a hedge around it [God’s love], dug a winepress
in it and built a tower [the temple]. And he leased it to vinedressers
[Israel’s leaders] and went into a far country. Now when
vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants [the prophets] to the
vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit. And the vinedressers
took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another. Again
he sent other servants, more than the first [continued mercy],
and they did likewise to them. Then last of all [notice the word,
“last”] he sent his son to them [near the close of “seventy times
seven”], saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ But when the vinedressers
saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the
heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’ So they took
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
164
him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him [their final
sin]” (Matthew 21:33-39, emphasis added).
Jesus asked those leaders, “ ‘Therefore when the owner of the vineyard
comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?’ They said to Him, ‘He will
destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers
who will render to him the fruits in their seasons’ ” (verses 40-41).
Did they realize what they were saying? Hardly! They had pronounced their
own doom.
Looking His antagonists squarely in the eye, Jesus declared in words of
burning truth, “Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken
from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it” (verse 43). The Master
Himself said it. The kingdom of God would be “taken” away from unbelieving
Israel in the flesh and given to another “nation.” Why? Because of their
horrific sin of crucifying “the Son” (see verses 38-39).
In His next parable, Jesus outlined the same historical sequence but
added details of the destruction of Jerusalem and the call of the Gentiles.
The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who arranged a
marriage for his son, and sent out his servants to call those who
were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to
come. Again, he sent out other servants, saying, “Tell those
who are invited. ‘See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen
and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to
the wedding.’ But they made light of it and went their ways,
one to his own farm, another to his business. And the rest
seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them.
But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent
out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their
city ( Matthew 22:2-7).
This literally took place in 70 A.D. Daniel’s prophecy was fulfilled:
“The people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary”
(Daniel 9:26). Continuing the parable, Jesus said, “Then he said to his
servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding’
” (Matthew 22:8-9). Thus Christ represented the call of the Gentiles at
the end of the “seventy weeks.”
“He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him” (John 1:11).
Matthew 23 contains the Savior’s final words of agony over Israel, His chosen
nation. Eight times during His last public exchange with Israel’s leaders,
our Messiah cried out, “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!”
Finally, with a broken heart, the Son of the Infinite God declared: “O
Calvary and the Divine Divorce
165
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets, and stones those who
are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen
gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! See! Your house
is left to you desolate” (Matthew 23:37-38). This time God was not saying:
“You blew it. Let’s try again.” Israel’s decision to crucify Christ would have
permanent consequences. The result would be a searing separation—a
painful, divine divorce. As a Jewish Christian myself, I want to stress that the
pain was on God’s side. It was unbelieving Israel that divorced herself from
Christ, her Faithful Lover, not vice versa.
Then “Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples
came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to
them, ‘Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one
stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down’ ”
(Matthew 24:1-2). In A.D. 70, the second temple was destroyed by
Romans and more than one million Jews perished. Such was the terrible
results of that divine divorce.
Based on Daniel 9 and the teaching of our Messiah, we discover that
the prophecy of “seventy times seven” represented the limits of national forgiveness
for the Jewish nation—as a nation (this does not apply to individuals).
When Stephen was stoned by the Sanhedrin in 34 A.D., that moment
was fraught with awful significance. It was so weighty that Stephen, “being
full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus
standing at the right hand of God.” “Look!” the holy martyr cried, “I see the
heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”
(Acts 7:55-56)
Jesus didn’t “stand up” without reason. A seismic shift was occurring. A
new day was dawning. What would happen next? It was time for the wall to
come tumbling down.

Chapter 28
When the Wall Tumbled Down
An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea
whose time has come.
— Victor Hugo (1802-1885)
In 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. Today there’s nothing left of it.
No longer is there a physical separation between East and West Germany.
The two are one. According to the Bible, this is exactly what Jesus Christ—
the Wall Breaker—accomplished for Jews and Gentiles. As it is written, “For
He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the
middle wall of separation” (Ephesians 2:14).
Solid New Testament truth is often quite different from what is taught
in seminaries and churches, or popularized in bestselling novels. One of the
biggest areas of confusion concerns Jews and Gentiles. Many have been
taught that God has two separate plans—one for Jewish people, another for
non-Jews. His plan for Gentiles is often applied to “The Church Age.” This
doctrine is a pillar of dispensationalism. Notable dispensationalist Charles C.
Ryrie clarified, “The Church/Israel distinction is the best way to determine
whether or not someone is a dispensationalist—the most important criterion.”
130 “Dispensationalism has its roots in [J.N.] Darby’s distinction between
Israel and the Church”131 Yet we must inquire, “Does the New Testament
really uphold dispensationalism’s ‘Two-Plan Distinction’?”
First, let’s back up a little. The ending of the “seventy times seven,”
Christ’s woes on the Pharisees, the transfer of the kingdom, the divine
divorce, and the destruction of the second temple—none of this meant that
all Israel had rejected its Messiah. Nor is it fair to categorically say, “The
Jews killed Christ.” No! This idea has horribly, unjustly, and cruelly fueled
167
anti-Semitism for almost 2,000 years. It was not primarily “the Jews” who
killed Christ, although there was a group of Jewish leaders who instigated
His death. On a deeper level, it was really proud human nature resisting the
humble One. It was your nature and mine. Jesus Christ died for “the sins of
the whole world” (1 John 2:2 KJV ).
Many Jewish people welcomed their Messiah. All 12 disciples were
Jewish. The Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost fell only on Jews. It was
3,000 Jews who were then baptized (see Acts 2:5,22,36,41,46). The early
Church in Jerusalem was Jewish. Soon “a great many of the priests were obedient
to the faith” (Acts 6:7). Apart from Luke, the entire New Testament
was written by Jews. The question must be asked, “Should we call this group
of Jewish believers in Jerusalem ‘Israel’ or ‘the Church’?” It’s obvious they
were both! Consider this: When Spirit-filled Stephen looked back into history,
what did he call Israel in Moses’ time? He called Israel, “the church in
the wilderness” (Acts 7:38, KJV, emphasis added). Thus, according to
Stephen—whose backward glance was enlightened by Holy Ghost perception—
Old Testament Israel was God’s Church!
As the early Jewish Church expanded into the Roman world, this question
was finally raised: “Is our Messiah only for us? What about the Gentiles?”
Then, unexpectedly, God’s Spirit fell on non-Jews (see Acts 10:44-45).
Slowly, narrowness and prejudice broke down. A Jewish council of believers
convened in Jerusalem to discuss “the Jew-Gentile issue” (see Acts 15).
Finally, the Spirit of the Lord broke through the fog and revealed what had
been accomplished by the Messiah. A new day had dawned. The wall had
come down. In the language of Mel Gibson’s film, it was demolished by The
Passion of the Christ, and by His cross.
Years later, Paul wrote to believing Gentiles: “Therefore remember
that you, once Gentiles in the flesh—who are called Uncircumcision by
what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands—that at that
time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of
Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and
without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far
off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our
peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of
separation…to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making
peace, and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body
through the cross” (Ephesians 2:11-16). Here Paul is quite clear. Believing
non-Jews were “once Gentiles…aliens from the commonwealth of Israel.”
But “now in Christ Jesus,” Jews and Gentiles have become “one.” It’s the
truth. So let’s come out of the fog! The Wall Breaker has smashed “the
middle wall of separation” to pieces.
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
168
Paul was enraptured by this theme and wrote a lot about it. “By which,
when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,
which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now
been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets: that the
Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body” (Ephesians 3:4-6). Here
Paul called this uniting of Jews and Gentiles into “the same body” the “mystery
of Christ,” which is “now” being revealed “by the Spirit.” This mystery
is more important than any mystery movie you might watch on TV. Again,
Paul wrote, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free,
there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus”
(Galatians 3:28). Pastors often say during marriage ceremonies, “What God
has joined together, let no man separate!” This now applies to Jews and
Gentiles in Jesus Christ.
According to the New Testament, believing Jews and believing
Gentiles are now one. The two combined are “Abraham’s seed” (Galatians
3:29). This is “the Israel of God” (Galatians 6:15-16). This “mystery” has
been accomplished by our Messiah’s painful passion. He did it. When He
died, He demolished the wall. Now think about it. Should Christians gather
theological bricks and rebuild the wall Jesus Christ died to abolish? Wouldn’t
this be an “anti-Christ” thing to do?
What about Paul’s controversial statement that “all Israel will be saved”
(Romans 11:26)? Many apply this to a mass conversion of Israelis at
Armageddon. The context reveals otherwise. When Paul wrote that “all
Israel will be saved,” he didn’t mean that at some point every Jewish person
would find salvation, for in the same chapter he wrote, “If by any means I
may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and save some of them”
(verse 14, emphasis added). Again, in the same chapter, Paul declared, “And
they [individual Jewish people] also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will
be grafted in” (verse 23, emphasis added). There’s that tiny word “if” again.
“All Israel will be saved,” but as we studied earlier, the big question is,
“Which Israel?” Remember, “They are not all Israel who are of Israel”
(Romans 9:6). There is an “Israel after the flesh” (1 Corinthians 10:18) and
an “Israel of God” (Galatians 6:16) made up of Jewish people and Gentiles
who believe in the Messiah. To apply the “all Israel” which “will be saved” to
a group of Jews or Israelis who are separate from God’s Church is to deny the
Wall Breaker’s specific and staggering accomplishment on the cross!
Who is the “all Israel” in Romans 11:26? The answer is in the context.
Paul wrote, “I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am an apostle of the
Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, if by any means I may provoke to jealousy
those who are my flesh and save some of them” (verses 13-14). Paul hoped
that as the Gentiles responded to his preaching about the Messiah, that this
When the Wall Tumbled Down
169
would “provoke…some” of his Jewish friends to reexamine the claims of
Christ. Hopefully, this would lead “some” to believe in Jesus. Then this combined
group of believing Jews and believing Gentiles would form the “all
Israel” which “will be saved.”
Now for the entire context: “For I do not desire, brethren, that you
should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinions;
that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the
Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: ‘The
Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from
Jacob; for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins’ ” (verses
25-27). Notice: when “the fullness of the Gentiles” has “come in” (verse
25, emphasis added), then “all Israel will be saved” (verse 26). Into what do
they “come in”? Into “the good olive tree” (verse 24 KJV) which is Israel!
Thus “all Israel” in verse 26 is a united group of believing Jews and Gentiles
who have responded to the good news and “come in.” To believe otherwise
is to deny the context, reject “the mystery of Christ,” and rebuild the wall
Jesus Himself shattered on Calvary.
God thundered on Mount Sinai that “if” the Israelites obeyed His voice,
“then” they would be “a special treasure…a kingdom of priests and a holy
nation” (Exodus 19:5-6). In a letter to believers, Peter quoted the same words
and applied them to God’s Church. “But you are a chosen generation, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people…who once were not a people
but are now the people of God” (1 Peter 2:9-10). In Old Testament days,
God spoke about “Israel My elect” (Isaiah 45:4). In New Testament times,
Paul also called true believers in the Messiah—both Jews and Gentiles—“the
elect of God” (Colossians 3:11-12).
Thus Peter and Paul agreed. They both quoted the exact words God
spoke about Israel and applied them to believers in Christ. They both
taught that believing Jews and non-Jews, together, are “the people of
God,” “the elect of God,” and “the Israel of God” (1 Peter 2:9-10;
Colossians 3:11-12; Galatians 6:16). The “two” are “one,” and are “of the
same body” (Ephesians 2:14-16; 3:6). Through His cross, the Messiah
Himself has performed this mysterious wedding ceremony. What God has
joined together, let no man separate!
For those familiar with the term, this is not “replacement theology,”
which teaches that “the Church” has categorically “replaced” Israel. Neither
is it “separation theology” (dispensationalism’s opposite error), which teaches
the unbiblical notion that God’s Israel and God’s Church are two distinct
entities—and never the twain shall meet. Rather, the truth is an “Israel of
God” theology (Galatians 6:14-16), which sees God having one faithful
Israel throughout history composed of true Israelites and true Gentiles who
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
170
believe in the Messiah (either looking forward to His cross in Old Testament
days or looking back to His all-sufficient atonement). Biblically speaking, we
should never exalt Jewish people (lest we build damnable pride in their
hearts) or put them down (exhibiting deadly pride ourselves). Read Romans
11:17-23. Instead, we should realize we all are equal at the nail-pierced feet
of the Crucified One. All of our sins put Him there—He loves us all.
Heavy fog on a highway can be dangerous. It often results in fatal car
wrecks. As we shall soon see, if we don’t come out of the fog of falsehood
about Jews and Gentiles, we may crash at Armageddon.

Chapter 29
1948: An Unsinkable Doctrine?
Truth is not determined by majority vote.
— Doug Gwyn
When the horrors of World War II were finally over and Hitler’s
Third Reich had come to an end, the world awoke to the nightmare of the
German dictator’s “final solution.” Approximately six million innocent
Jews had been brutally murdered—many in gas chambers inside of death
camps. Public opinion then favored the return of the Jewish people to
their ancient homeland.
The British controlled Palestine until May of 1948. On May 14,
empowered by a resolution of the United Nations, the Zionist Movement
proclaimed the rebirth of the State of Israel. For almost 2,000 years the
Jewish people had been “wanderers among the nations.” Now they were
home. Yet their struggles had just begun.
An Arab League composed of Egyptians, Iraqis, Syrians, and Jordanians
quickly invaded Palestine in an attempt to crush out the new nation. The
fighting was heavy. Yet by 1949 the Arabs were defeated, and Israel was still
in the land. In May of 1967, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria prepared for another
attack. The Israelis struck first, and the war was over in six days. In 1973, at
the beginning of the Jewish season of Yom Kippur, the Egyptians and Syrians
attacked again. The battles were fierce and bloody. Yet by 1974, Israel was
again on top and still in the land.
For more than 50 years these astonishing events have gripped the attention
of much of the Christian world. A conclusion has been reached by millions:
This must be the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. This conviction is now
173
being expressed on TV, radio, in books and magazines, at prophecy conferences,
in Christian seminaries, and on the worldwide web. The rebirth of the
State of Israel in 1948 is now considered by countless Christians to be the
most significant prophetic event of the 20th century.
An example of this belief may be found in the popular book, The
Next 7 Great Events of the Future, by Randal Ross. The author declares: “I
call the establishment of the State of Israel ‘the ultimate prophecy time
bomb,’ because when Israel became a legitimate state in the eyes of the
world in May 1948, that single, seemingly isolated incident started the
prophetic time clock ticking down toward the ‘zero hour’ and the end of
time.”137 Hal Lindsey dittoed, “Since the restoration of Israel as a nation in
1948, we have lived in the most significant period of prophetic history.”133
Today, the majority of Christian beliefs about the end times rest firmly
upon this 1948 platform.
On April 10, 1912, the Titanic set sail from England for America. The
largest ship in the world at that time, she was considered unsinkable. But
after four days of smooth sailing, she hit the ice. Three hours later she was
underneath freezing water, floating down to the bottom of the Atlantic
Ocean. In many ways, the 1948 theory is like the Titanic. In the minds of
countless believers, it is considered unsinkable. However, in a few moments,
this popular theory is going to hit the ice of God’s Word. If it begins to sink,
we should abandon ship as soon as possible.
There are three main arguments now being used to support the theory
that Bible prophecy was fulfilled in 1948. Let’s examine them.
1. The “Fig Tree” Argument.
Hal Lindsey wrote: “Jesus predicts an extremely important
time clue. He says, ‘Now learn a parable of the fig tree’
[Matthew 24:32, 33 quoted]…The most important sign in
Matthew has to be the restoration of the Jews to the land in
the rebirth of Israel…When the Jewish people…became a
nation again on 14 May 1948 the ‘fig tree’ put forth its first
leaves. Jesus said that this would indicate that He was ‘at the
door,’ ready to return.”134
Is this really what “Jesus said”? In a parallel passage,
Luke records: “Then He spoke to them a parable: Look at the
fig tree, and all the trees. When they are already budding,
you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near. So
you also, when you see these things happening, know that
the kingdom of God is near” (Luke 21:29-31).
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
174
Because Luke wrote, “and all the trees. When they
are already budding,” we clearly see Jesus did not have in
mind just one tree representing Israel in 1948. In
Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus explained His parable of the fig
tree. “So you also, when you see all these things, know that
it is near—at the doors!” (Matthew 24:33) When fig trees,
and all trees, start blooming at the end of winter, we know
summer is near. “So…also,” said Jesus, when we see “all
these” various signs given in Matthew 24 occurring at the
same time, then we may know His return is near. The fig
tree is not the sign. It simply represents “all” the signs in
Matthew 24, none of which is the specified rebirth of Israel
in 1948. The ice of God’s Word has just ripped the first
hole in the bottom of the 1948 ship.
2. The “Israeli Victories” Argument.
Many view the Israeli victories in 1949, 1967, and 1973
as strong evidence that God had regathered Israel and was
now fighting for His chosen nation, even though the leadership
of that nation still firmly rejects its own Messiah. Again,
let’s examine the argument.
First of all, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today,
and forever” (Hebrews 13:8). God says, “I am the Lord, I do
not change” (Malachi 3:6). With this principle in mind, let’s
ask, “Was God able to fight for Israel in the Old Testament
when they were in unbelief?”
After the Exodus, God promised to bring Israel into the
land of Canaan (see Exodus 33:1-3). Twelve men were sent
to spy out the territory. Yet after all the people heard the
“bad report” about “the giants” in the land, they “complained
against Moses,” saying, “Let us return to Egypt”
(Numbers 13:32-33; 14:2,4). Then God pronounced this
judgment: “But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this
wilderness. And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness
forty years.…and you shall know My rejection [breach of
promise, KJV]” (Numbers 14:32,34, emphasis added). Thus,
because of Israel’s unbelief, God was unable to fulfill His
promise to that generation. This proves that God can make a
promise, but not fulfill it to a certain group of people. See also
1 Samuel 2:30.
1948: An Unsinkable Doctrine?
175
Those ancient Israelites were unwilling to accept that
40-year sentence. The people proposed to go up anyway “to
the place which the Lord has promised” (Numbers 14:40).
Moses said, “This will not succeed. Do not go up…for the
Lord is not among you.…the Lord will not be with
you.…But they presumed to go up.…Then the Amalekites
and the Canaanites…came down and attacked them”
(Numbers 14:41-45). This passage is full of instruction.
Because of Israel’s unbelief, God could not fight for her. Even
though He promised, He wouldn’t fulfill it. Years later, when
Israel again “forsook the Lord…they could no longer stand
before their enemies” (Judges 2:13-14). This truth is repeated
many times in Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles,
Jeremiah, etc.
Again, God does not change (see Malachi 3:6). All
throughout sacred history, He could not fight for Israel
while they were in unbelief. Thus He could not have been
fighting for the Jewish nation in 1949, 1967, and 1973.
Because a nation wins battles is not evidence in itself that
God is fighting for that nation. Was God fighting for
Hitler when he won so many battles? Was the Lord with
the Nazis when they successfully incinerated so many Jews
in crematoriums? Obviously not! Dear friend, the “Israeli
victories” argument is not based on a thorough study of the
Word of God. Ice has just ripped a second hole in the hull
of this unsinkable theory.
3. The End Time Regathering Argument.
This is the big one. The idea is now being expressed
all around the globe that ancient prophecies which predicted
a regathering of Israel back to their land were fulfilled
in 1948. The main prophecy quoted is found in
Ezekiel chapters 36-38.
In Chapter 4 of The Late Great Planet Earth, Hal
Lindsey gives the following three reasons why Ezekiel’s
prophecy must point to a 1948 fulfillment:
a. God told Israel: “I will take you from among the heathen,
and gather you out of all countries, and bring you into
your own land” (Ezekiel 36:24 KJV).
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
176
b. The phrase, “out of all countries,” must apply to “worldwide
dispersion,” and therefore cannot apply to the
Babylonian captivity.
c. Ezekiel’s prophecy will be fulfilled “in the latter days”
(38:16) which supposedly is a “definite term” applying
to “the time just preceding” the second coming of
Jesus Christ.135
These reasons are accepted as unsinkable evidence of a
1948 fulfillment.
At first glance, Hal’s arguments seem conclusive. But
the following five responses not only cast doubt upon
Lindsey’s three points, but also prove that prophecy could
not have been fulfilled in 1948.
a. God specifically told ancient Israel He would gather
them “from all the nations” immediately “after seventy
years are completed at Babylon” (Jeremiah 29:10,14,18).
Thus an out-of-“all-nations” gathering need not apply to
the end times.
b. The time period right after the Babylonian captivity was
also called “the latter days” (see Jeremiah 29:10-14; 30:24;
27:2-7; 48:47; 49:39; 50:1); thus this phrase is not always
a “definite term” applying to “the time just preceding”
Christ’s return, as Lindsey claims. Moses also told ancient
Israel, “I know that after my death…evil will befall you in
the latter days” (Deuteronomy 31:29).
c. Three times in Ezekiel 38, the regathered Israelites are
described as a people who “dwell safely… dwelling without
walls” (verses 8,11,14). These words “safely” and
“without walls [of protection]” do not apply to modern
Israelis who now “dwell” amidst terrorists, experience regular
attacks from Islamic Jihad, and witness friends being
blown apart by suicide bombers.
d. The reason Israel was scattered in Old Testament times
was because she forsook God, broke His law, and disobeyed
His word (see Jeremiah 16:10-13; 29:18-19). If you
look carefully, according to the same Old Testament passages,
Israel must first repent of her sins before such a
regathering can be accomplished by God.
1948: An Unsinkable Doctrine?
177
Here’s the proof. God told Israel: “It shall come to pass,
when all these things come upon you, the blessing and
the curse…and you shall call them to mind among all
the nations where the Lord your God drives you, and you
shall return to the Lord your God and obey His
voice…then the Lord your God will bring you back from
captivity…and gather you again from all the nations”
(Deuteronomy 30:1-3, KJV emphasis added).
According to these inspired words, when God scatters
Israel among “all the nations,” if she returns and obeys His
voice, then He will gather her. If she doesn’t return and
obey, then this prophecy cannot be fulfilled by God.
Because the Messiah has come, this “return to the Lord”
must include fully embracing Jesus Christ. The facts of history
reveal that Jewish Zionism did not meet this spiritual
condition in 1948.
Again, God told ancient Israel, “If you are unfaithful, I
will scatter you among the nations; but if you return to
Me…yet I will gather them” (Nehemiah 1:8-9, emphasis
added). “And you will seek Me and find Me, when you
search for Me with all your heart. I will be found by you,
says the Lord, and I will bring you back from your captivity;
I will gather you from all the nations” (Jeremiah
29:13-14). These Scriptures are plain. Israel must first
repent, then God will gather her. Once again, this condition
was not met by the Zionist movement in 1948. The
“unsinkable” theory is starting to go down. “Lower the
lifeboats” is the cry from Heaven!
Even Ezekiel 36 contains conditional elements. Notice
carefully, “Thus says the Lord God: ‘On the day that I
cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable
you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt”
(Ezekiel 36:33). Thus, “on the day” God cleanses Israel
from “all” of her sins, on that day He would “also enable”
her to dwell in her cities. This did not happen in 1948.
Israel as a nation was not cleansed from “all” her iniquities
at that time. Especially had it not forsaken its
Heaven-confronting sin of rejecting God’s Son (see
Matthew 21:37-39).
Jonah predicted, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown!” (Jonah 3:4) Yet forty days later, Nineveh
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
178
remained unscratched. Why? Because the prophecy was
conditional. Nineveh repented, so God’s judgment was
deferred. The same conditional elements are also found in
the regathering prophecies. Because Israel did not first
repent and return to the Lord Jesus Christ, the promises of
regathering could not have been fulfilled by God in 1948.
e. Ezekiel declared: “Now the word of the Lord came to me,
saying, ‘Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land
of Magog.…In the latter years you will come into the land
of those brought back from the sword and gathered from
many people….You will ascend, coming like a
storm….against a people gathered from the
nations….And it will come to pass at the same time, when
Gog comes against the land of Israel,’ says the Lord God,
‘that My fury will show in My face….I will rain down on
him, on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with
him, flooding rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.…
Then they shall know that I am the Lord’ ”
(Ezekiel 38:1-2,8-9,12,18,22-23).
Chapter 5 of The Late Great Planet Earth is called, “Russia Is
a Gog.” There Hal Lindsey applied the Ezekiel 38 prophecy
to 1948 and then to a final Middle East conflict between
Russia and Israel. Yet the explosive truth is that the Book of
Revelation actually applies Ezekiel’s prophecy to a global
event predicted to occur at the end of the millennium.
Earlier we discovered how Matthew took Hosea 11:1,
which originally applied to Israel, and then declared it
“fulfilled” in Jesus Christ (Matthew 2:15). We also saw
how Paul made a similar Old Testament to New
Testament application when he applied “the seed of
Abraham,” which was definitely “Israel,” to “one…who is
Christ” (Isaiah 41:8 KJV; Galatians 3:16). Amazingly,
Revelation 20 does the same thing with Ezekiel 38.
Revelation 20:7-9 says:
Now when the thousand years have expired, satan will be
released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations
which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to
gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of
the sea. They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded
the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire
came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.
1948: An Unsinkable Doctrine?
179
The major elements are the same. Both Ezekiel 38 and
Revelation 20 speak about Gog, Magog, a great army, a
final gathering for battle against Jerusalem, and fire from
Heaven. Yet Revelation 20 applies these things to the end
of the millennium, to a global Gog and Magog, and to a
final global battle against the saints and the beloved city,
which is the New Jerusalem (see Revelation 3:12; 21:10;
Hebrews 12:22). Thus Revelation 20 takes what originally
applied to Israel and applies it to a final global battle against
the saints of Jesus Christ who are inside the New Jerusalem at
the end of the millennium.
Why does Revelation do this? For the same reason we discussed
earlier: So that the “word of God” won’t be made of
“no effect” in spite of the unbelief of many natural Jews
(Romans 9:6). God did promise in Ezekiel 38 (and in
Zechariah 14) that He would defend Israel and Jerusalem
during a final battle. And He will. He will defend His
Israel in the Spirit which will dwell inside the New
Jerusalem at the end of the millennium. According to
Revelation 20, this is how Ezekiel 38 will be fulfilled. The
big question is: Are we willing to accept the New Testament’s
inspired application of Old Testament prophecies? If not, we
are not being faithful to “the whole counsel of God” (Acts
20:27, emphasis added).
On April 15, 1912, at 2:20 a.m., the unsinkable Titanic was fully underwater.
A third of her passengers sat shivering in lifeboats, yet the majority
were corpses plunging lifelessly through dark waters toward the Atlantic
Ocean’s murky bottom. How about us? Will we abandon the “1948 ship”
before we get into serious trouble? Our Captain is pleading, “Get into the
lifeboats!” If we refuse, we may sink far below the safety of God’s Word.

If the Apocalyptic Israel were proved not to be the literal
Israel, there is not a Futurist but would admit that their cause
was lost.
— Edward B. Elliott (1793-1875)136
We have reached the heart of Israel Delusions. It is finally time to
study the Book of Revelation. As we open its sacred pages, we discover statements
about “Mount Zion” (14:1), “the twelve tribes of Israel” (7:4-8),
“Jerusalem” (21:10), “the temple” (11:19), “Sodom and Egypt” (11:8),
“Babylon” (17:5), “Gog and Magog” (20:8), “the great river Euphrates”
(16:12), and “Armageddon” (16:16). Thus, it is obvious that Revelation
uses the terminology and geography of the Middle East in its prophecies.
What is happening right now all over Planet Earth is that evangelical scholars
are applying most of these terms literally—to those literal places, and to
the Jewish nation in the Middle East. Here’s the explosive question: Does
our Lord intend for these prophecies to be literally applied to “Israel after
the flesh” (1 Corinthians 10:18), or should they be applied to “the Israel of
God” (Galatians 6:16) in Jesus Christ?
To discover the answer, the beginning is the best place to start. The very
first sentence of God’s last Book calls it, “The Revelation of Jesus Christ”
(Revelation 1:1). Thus Jesus Himself is Revelation’s Source, Center, and true
Interpreter. This will become highly significant soon. Beyond this, in chapter
one, John was “in the Spirit” when he received his vision (verse 10). Thus
the entire Book was originally seen by John through Spirit-illuminated eyes,
not flesh-vision. A key lesson is: We also need our eyes brightened by the
Holy Spirit in order to interpret Revelation’s message correctly.
181
John beheld the Risen One walking “in the midst of the seven lampstands”
(verse 13). The idea of “seven lampstands” takes our minds back to the
seven-branched candlestick inside the Jewish temple before it was destroyed
in 70 A.D. by Roman armies. Yet in Revelation, the “seven lampstands” are
not literal, but clearly symbolic. What do they represent? Explaining “the
mystery,” the true Interpreter declared, “…the seven lampstands which you
saw are the seven churches” (Revelation 1:20, emphasis added). Thus, in
Revelation’s very first chapter, Jesus took something extremely Jewish and
used it symbolically to represent His Church. As we shall see, this is one of the
key interpretive principles to understanding the entire Book.
In Revelation 2, in a dictated letter to “the church in Thyatira” (verse
18), Jesus reproved His people for allowing “that woman Jezebel, who calls
herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants…” (verse 20). Jezebel
was a wicked woman in Old Testament times who entered Israel and caused
problems. Was Jesus saying “Jezebel” had been reincarnated, or resurrected,
and was literally teaching deception within Thyatira? Obviously not. A little
reflection reveals He used the word, “Jezebel,” as a symbol of an evil movement
that was affecting His Church. As with the seven golden candlesticks,
God’s Messiah took something from Jewish history and applied it to His
Church, “the Israel of God” (Galatians 6:16).
In Revelation 3, the Heavenly Interpreter dictated another letter to
“the church in Philadelphia” (verse 7) in which He said a Christian could
become “a pillar in the temple of My God,” and have a place in “the city of
My God, the New Jerusalem” (verse 12). Don’t miss the significance of this.
Not only did Jesus again use Jewish imagery—the temple—and apply it symbolically
to His Church, but He also identified another city, “the New
Jerusalem,” as God’s headquarters. And this city will not be a remodeled
earthly Jerusalem with its bullet holes covered and the blood of suicide
bombers scrubbed away. This one “comes down out of heaven” (verse 12).
What about Revelation’s prophecy of the river Euphrates drying up
before Armageddon? The Word says, “The sixth angel poured out his bowl
on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of
the kings from the east might be prepared” (Revelation 16:12). Does this
apply to the literal river Euphrates flowing near Baghdad, which our
American troops crossed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, or is something
more intended?
The popular website, AboutBibleProphecy.com, in words which reflect
usual Middle East literalism, reports:
In Revelation 16:12, the Bible says there will come a
time when the Euphrates River becomes dry so that an army
can cross it and march into Israel. When the book of
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
182
Revelation was written 1900 years ago, it would have
taken a great natural disaster, or a great amount of labor
to divert the flow of the Euphrates so that an army could
cross it. (In 539 BC, Cyrus and his army diverted the flow
so that his troops could march across the riverbed and
conquer Babylon). But, today, there are a series of dams
that would make it much easier to divert the flow of the
powerful river.137
Applying the same prophecy to “a vast Oriental army” and “a war in the
Middle East,” Hal Lindsey wrote:
The Euphrates has presented a formidable problem for
the corps of engineers of many ancient armies of the past. In
this future invasion, however, God Himself will see to it that
the river is dried up so that a trap is set for triggering the last
great war of mankind.138
Thus when AboutBibleProphecy.com, Hal Lindsey, and countless others
read about the Euphrates drying up, they interpret this literally. The
“kings of the east” are often assumed to be Chinese kings or warriors whose
foot soldiers will someday cross a dry riverbed before attacking Israel at
Armageddon. This is how Revelation 16:12 is expected to be fulfilled. Yet we
cannot help but wonder: Why would an Asian country ever launch such an
army against Jerusalem? And if one did attack Israel, why would its leaders
first send their army so far north to cross the Euphrates? Why not plan a more
direct attack, send planes, launch missiles, or drop bombs?
I am about to prove that such Middle East literalism fails miserably to
discern the true meaning and genius of the Book of Revelation. It also misses
the fact that Revelation is simply using Old Testament terms, history, and
geography as symbols—just like Jesus did when He mentioned “Jezebel”—
that are meant to be applied in a special, spiritual sense. On August 9, 1945,
the United States government finally decided to drop an atomic bomb called
the “Fat Man” upon Nagasaki. It is now time to drop our version of the “Fat
Man” upon the popular Middle East method of interpreting Bible prophecy.
“The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates,
and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might
be prepared” (Revelation 16:12). In order to understand these words, we
must first study some ancient Bible history about Israel and Babylon. In
605 B.C., Babylon conquered Jerusalem and took the Jews captive for 70
years (see Daniel 9:2). After 70 years, an amazing set of circumstances
occurred. The Euphrates was dried up, Babylon was conquered from the
east, and Israel was delivered. As we shall see, this forms the background
for a true understanding of Revelation 16:12.
When the Euphrates Runs Dry
183
Ancient Babylon sat on the river Euphrates (see Jeremiah 51:63-64),
and was surrounded by a massive wall of protection. The Euphrates flowed
through Babylon, entering and exiting through two gates in the wall whose
bars reached down to the riverbed. When those two gates, or “double doors”
were completely shut and all other entrances were closed, Babylon was
impregnable. Yet she was to fall suddenly and be destroyed (see Jeremiah
51:8). Then God would call Israel, saying, “My people, go out of the midst of
her!” (Jeremiah 51:45) As we shall soon see, these exact words are repeated
in Revelation to God’s spiritual Israel about the necessity of coming out of
Mystery Babylon (see Revelation 17:4-5; 18:2-8).
In 538 B.C., on the night of ancient Babylon’s fall, her king and subjects
were drunk with wine (see Daniel 5). So were the guards, and they forgot
to fully close the double doors. Over 100 years earlier, God had predicted
concerning Babylon and the Euphrates, “I will dry up your rivers” (Isaiah
44:27). The Lord also spoke about a man named “Cyrus,” who conquered
Babylon, saying, “[I will] open before him the double doors, so that the gates
will not be shut” (Isaiah 45:1). Moreover God called Cyrus “My shepherd”
and “His anointed” (Isaiah 44:28; 45:1). Thus Cyrus was a type of Jesus
Christ. And he came “from the east” (Isaiah 46:11)!
Inside the British Museum in London lies the famous Cyrus Cylinder
which describes how Cyrus conquered Babylon. According to history’s
report, Cyrus and his army dug trenches upstream alongside of the river
Euphrates, which diverted the water, causing the river to slowly go down as
it ran through Babylon. No one noticed. One dark night, at the height of
Belshazzar’s drunken feast, the water became low enough for Cyrus and his
men to quietly sneak under the double doors, which had been left open.
Quickly they overran the doomed city, slew the king (see Daniel 5:30), and
conquered Babylon. Then Cyrus issued a decree to let Israel go (see Ezra 1).
Revelation uses the events, geography, and terminology of the Old
Testament, and then brilliantly applies them universally to Jesus Christ, the
Israel of God, and spiritual Babylon at the end of time. A failure to discern
this principle has resulted in a massive misunderstanding of Revelation, a
false Middle-East focus, and end time delusions.
In Revelation 17, a shiny angel said to John: “Come, I will show you the
judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters….So he carried me
away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet
beast which was full of names of blasphemy….having in her hand a golden
cup….And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON
THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS” (Revelation 17:1,3-5). Just
like in Revelation chapter one, John was again “in the Spirit” when he
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
184
beheld this satanic seducer. Even so must we be “in the Spirit” in order to
understand what this apocalyptic prostitute is really all about.
John saw the harlot sitting “on many waters,” just like ancient Babylon
sat upon the Euphrates river. Yet in Revelation, these “many waters” do not
refer to the literal river Euphrates which today flows near Saddam Hussein’s
bombed-out Iraqi palaces. No! Revelation’s angel interpreter said, “The
waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations,
and tongues” (Revelation 17:15).
The genius of Revelation is that it uses the history of the Old Testament
and then applies it spiritually to a Mystery Babylon which now sits upon the
“many waters” of a spiritual river Euphrates. According to the angelic interpreter,
this river of “many waters” actually represents “peoples, multitudes,
nations, and tongues” around the world that support the harlot and her global
deceptions (see Revelation 17:15; 18:23). Echoing the ancient words of
Jeremiah, yet applying them spiritually and globally, Revelation proclaims,
“Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
of the wine of the wrath of her fornication” (Revelation 14:8).
The error of those who adopt the “literal Middle-East method” of interpretation
stems from: (1) The belief that these prophecies must apply to
Israel after the flesh, (2) A failure to study the Old Testament’s “root” history
behind Revelation’s prophecies, (3) A failure to apply that history spiritually
and universally to God’s Israel in the Holy Spirit, and (4) A failure to center
Revelation entirely in Jesus Christ and His global enemies. Modern interpreters
usually apply the words “Babylon,” “Euphrates,” and “kings of the
east” to a literal city, a literal river, and literal armies in the Middle East. Yet
Revelation speaks of that “which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt,” about
a “Mystery Babylon,” and about “many waters” that represent “peoples, multitudes,
nations, and tongues” (Revelation 11:8; 17:1,5,15).
In 1887, H. Grattan Guinness insightfully wrote:
Futurism is literalism, and literalism in the interpretation
of symbols is a denial of their symbolic character. It is an
abuse and degradation of the prophetic word, and a destruction
of its influence. It substitutes the imaginary for the real,
the grotesque and monstrous for the sober and reasonable.139
This issue can be compared to the wearing of two different pairs of glasses.
If we put on the “literal Middle-East glasses” we will “see” Revelation’s
prophecies as applying only to literal places and Israel after the flesh. But if
we put on the “Middle-East symbolism glasses” and read Revelation through
the Spirit’s aid, we will “see” these prophecies applying to the Israel of God
in the Holy Spirit. Paul wrote to Christians, “But you are not in the flesh but
When the Euphrates Runs Dry
185
in the Spirit” (Romans 8:9). If we put on the wrong glasses and interpret
prophecy according to the flesh, we will end up blinder than a bat in daylight.
But if we put on the right glasses and interpret prophecy through the enlightenment
of the Spirit of truth (see John 16:13), then we will say, “I was blind,
now I see” (John 9:25).
A woman in prophecy represents a church. The Church of Jesus
Christ is called “His wife” who makes “herself ready” for the marriage supper
of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-8). What about that other evil woman?
Hold onto your seat. In a few moments I will prove—as Protestants have
done for centuries—that the Babylonian whore represents a false form of
Christianity that leads “peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues” away
from the pure truth of Heaven’s Lamb. She is the net result of “the falling
away” Paul predicted in 2 Thessalonians 2:3. As Guinness perceptively
revealed, “The contrast is between Church and Church; the faithful
Church and the apostate Church.”140
Specifically, Hell’s Harlot has these identifiable characteristics:
1. She is a “Mother” (Revelation 17:5).
2. She has harlot daughters (Revelation 17:5).
3. She sits on “seven mountains” (Revelation 17:9 .
4. Her colors are “purple and scarlet” (Revelation 17:4).
5. She is extremely wealthy with lots of “gold”
(Revelation 17:4).
6. She is “drunk with the blood of the saints”
(Revelation 17:6).
7. She is a “great city” (Revelation 17:18).
8. She has ruled “over the kings of the earth”
(Revelation 17:18).
9. She intoxicates “all nations” with her “wine”
(Revelation 14:8).
10. Many of God’s own people are still inside of her
(Revelation 18:4).
Bestselling evangelical author Dave Hunt, whose 20-plus books have
combined sales of over 3,000,000 copies, has tackled this topic head-on in his
penetrating book, A Woman Rides the Beast: The Roman Catholic Church and
the Last Days, published by Harvest House. Chapter titles include: “Mystery,
Babylon,” “A City on Seven Hills,” “Blood of Martyrs,” “Dominion over
Kings,” “What about Mary?” “Sacrifice of the Mass,” and “The Reformation
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
186
Betrayed.” Marshalling a vast amount of evidence from Scripture, church history,
and the Protestant Reformation, Hunt easily concludes, “The leaders of
the Reformation were certain that she [the woman of Revelation 17] represented
the Roman Catholic Church….”141 Hunt agrees. With a pen dipped in
concern for both Protestants (who have lost their knowledge of history) and
sincere Roman Catholics, Mr. Hunt reveals that an apostate form of
“Christianity will take over the world…not real Christianity but an
Antichrist counterfeit thereof.”142
During the first Persian Gulf war Saddam Hussein made a feeble
attempt to begin rebuilding the ancient city of Babylon whose ruins now lie
about 50 miles south of Baghdad. When he did, prophecy books came pouring
off Christian presses declaring, “Look! Prophecy is being fulfilled.
Babylon is rising!” At the same time, journalist John Elson’s article,
Apocalypse Now? appeared on the last page of the February 11, 1991 issue of
Time magazine. Elson insightfully commented, “The temptation to seek clues
to the Second Coming on CNN is easy to understand, since Saddam Hussein
has proclaimed himself a successor to Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king
who enslaved the Israelites of old. That makes it deceptively easy for prophecy
mongers to identify Iraq with Babylon. Somewhat awkwardly, it also undercuts
a long standing Protestant tradition that this symbol of corruption refers to the
Church of Rome.”143 Amazing!
End Time Delusions adheres to the historic Protestant view, not futuristic
fables. Along with Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Spurgeon, Wylie, Hunt, and
countless others, this book also recognizes the woman riding the beast symbolizes
“the Church of Rome.” No other church fits every specification of the
prophecy, nor does any other organization for that matter. Chillingly, the
Roman Church even calls herself “Holy Mother Church,” “…the mother
and teacher of all the churches.”144 Yet prophecy gives her another title—
“The Mother of Harlots” (Revelation 17:5).
H. Grattan Guinness offers this hard-to-refute summary:
Now, in conclusion, read this wonderful prophecy concerning
“Babylon the Great” in the clear and all-revealing light of
history. I ask those of you who have read the history of the last
eighteen centuries, did not Rome Christian become a harlot?
Did not Papal Rome ally itself with the kings of the earth? Did
it not glory itself to be as a queen, and call itself the Mistress
of the World? Did it not ride upon the body of the beast, or
fourth empire, and govern its actions for centuries? Did not
Papal Rome array itself with gold and precious stones and
pearls? Is not this its attire still? We appeal to facts. Go to the
churches and see. Look at the priests; look at the cardinals;
When the Euphrates Runs Dry
187
look at the popes; look at the purple robes they wear; look at
the scarlet robes; look at the encrusted jewels; look at the luxurious
palaces in which they live; look at the eleven thousand
halls and chambers in the Vatican, and the unbounded wealth
and glory gathered there; look at the glorious spectacles in St.
Peter’s at Rome, casting even the magnificence of royalty into
the shade. Go and see these things, or read the testimony of
those who have seen them. Shamelessly Rome wears the very
raiment, the very hues and colors, portrayed on the pages of
inspired prophecy. You may know the harlot by her attire, as
certainly as by the name upon her brow. 145
Mystery Babylon is called, “The Mother of Harlots.” But wait a minute!
Think carefully. A “Mother” must have children. Prophecy says the Scarlet
Woman is actually a Mother of “Harlots.” That little “s” at the end of
“Harlots” reveals that the Mother Church must have harlot daughters. If the
“Mother” refers to a church, then a little reflection reveals that her daughters
must also refer to churches and organizations that, while claiming separation
from Rome, nevertheless teach fundamental doctrines that really originate
with Mom. Solemn thought!
Further proof that the Mother and Daughters represent, as Dave Hunt
states, “not real Christianity but an Antichrist counterfeit thereof,” comes
from the fact before King Jesus Christ returns in the clouds, God calls His
own people to leave Babylon’s infernal grip. “And I heard another voice from
heaven, saying, ‘Come out of her, My people, lest you share in her sins, and
lest you receive of her plagues’ ” (Revelation 18:4). In the Old Testament,
when Cyrus dried up the literal Euphrates, this exact same call was given by
God to literal Jews urging them to come out of literal Babylon. “My people,”
the Lord pleaded through Jeremiah, “go out of the midst of her! And let
everyone deliver himself from the fierce anger of the Lord” (Jeremiah 51:45).
This exact same call is issued in Revelation to those within spiritual Babylon.
Now don’t miss this point. If Babylon in Revelation is a spiritual Babylon,
then the Israel that God calls out must be a spiritual Israel. We must all come
out lest we “share her sins” (Revelation 18:4).
“Come out of her, My people” (Revelation 18:4, emphasis added), says
the Lord. Thus God considers many of His own people to be yet inside of
Mystery Babylon. This must refer to large numbers—both Protestant and
Catholic—of real Christians who are serving the Lord to the best of their
ability. This must also apply to many who are even now teaching false
prophecy. Yet God still calls them “My people.” Because He knows their
hearts, God mercifully still sees them as part of His spiritual Israel. But they
are confused! In fact, Babylon means “confusion.” Because of today’s global
religious confusion, especially about Bible prophecy, millions of the Lord’s
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
188
people now believe end time delusions about Babylon and Israel. Yet according
to Revelation 18:4, Jesus Christ is now calling us all to “come out” of spiritual
confusion and into the pure light of His Word. We must leave Babylon
before it’s too late. Why? Because soon the river will run dry.
“The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and
its water was dried up” (Revelation 16:12). “Babylon the Great” now sits on
“the great river Euphrates.” According to the Angel, this river represents
“peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues” around the world who support
the false doctrines of Mystery Babylon. Right before the end, “the sixth
angel” will pour out “his bowl upon the great river Euphrates.” This bowl is
one of the seven “bowls of the wrath of God” (Revelation 16:1). Thus, it is
the wrath of God—not Turkey —that will dry up the Euphrates. What does
it mean? Brace yourself. It means that God’s wrath will eventually be poured
upon living people around the world who continue supporting the deceptions
of Mystery Babylon all the way until the end!
When “peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues,” who have resisted
the Holy Spirit’s truth-arrows and continued to support the Mistress of
Temptation finally experience God’s burning wrath, the scales will be ripped
from their eyes. They will realize they’ve been duped—big time. What loving
conviction failed to accomplish, God’s justice finally will. Then they will
turn on their teachers, preachers, and priests with madness and fury. What a
frightening scene! They will “hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked,
eat her flesh and burn her with fire” (Revelation 17:16). Then their support
for the Mystery whore will vanish. This is how Babylon’s water will dry up,
preparing the way for the “kings from the east” (Revelation 16:12).
Cyrus came from “the east” to conquer ancient Babylon (see Isaiah
44:26-28; 46:11). The word “east” literally means, “sun rising,” and the name
“Cyrus” means “sun.” Cyrus was a type of Jesus Christ, “the Sun of
Righteousness” (see Malachi 4:2). In Revelation, God’s holy angels come
from the east (see Revelation 7:2). Jesus said, “As the lightning comes from
the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man
be” (Matthew 24:27). Our Messiah is coming from the east with the armies
of heaven as “KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS” (Revelation
19:14,16). Thus, the “kings of the east” are not Asian hordes or Chinese warriors,
but King Jesus and His armies which will descend from the eastern skies
to conquer Babylon and deliver Israel at Armageddon!
But which Israel will Jesus deliver? It will surely be an Israel in the Spirit
which, having chosen to walk in the Spirit and to interpret prophecy according
to the Spirit, has also chosen to “come out” of Mystery Babylon and to
forsake its fleshy ways (see Galatians 5:16, 25; Revelation 18:4).
Let’s be part of that Israel.

Chapter 31
Frogs, Fables, and Armageddon
Truth is the only safe ground to stand on.
— Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902)
Most people don’t like frogs, yet I enjoyed catching them as a kid. Did
you know the Book of Revelation talks about frogs? Interestingly, it connects
them with the battle of Armageddon.
John wrote, “I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the
mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of
the false prophet. For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go
out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the
battle of that great day of God Almighty….And they gathered them together
to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon” (Revelation 16:13-14,16).
Based on the context, the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet represent
the three parts of Mystery Babylon (see verse 19). A careful reading of
Revelation 16:13-16 reveals that Armageddon involves a final global battle
between the dragon, the beast, the false prophet, the three froglike spirits,
the kings of the whole world, and God Almighty.
Symbolism is involved here. The “dragon” is earlier said to have seven
heads and ten horns (see Revelation 12:3), and so does “the beast” (see
Revelation 13:1). The “false prophet”—the third member of this unholy trinity—
is also referred to as “another beast” with “two horns like a lamb” but
which speaks as a dragon (see Revelation 13:11). Three froglike spirits eventually
speak to the entire world through the lips of these three seducers.
Clearly this involves global end time delusions. The “dragon” is a symbol of
satan himself (see Revelation 12:9) and “the beast” represents the papal
power. What about the “false prophet”? Think about it. What comes from
191
false prophets anyway? False prophecy. Therefore—while this may not be the
full message of the text—Revelation’s highly symbolic language about a froglike
spirit speaking through the lips of a “false prophet” could easily represent
a massive system of “false prophecy” that is now deceiving millions about the
beast itself, Babylon, Israel and Armageddon.
A plague of frogs was one of the ten plagues of Egypt. “Aaron
stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up
and covered the land of Egypt” (Exodus 8:6). This forms the background
for Revelation 16:13. In the Old Testament, frogs came up from “the
waters of Egypt.” In Revelation 16:12-13, three froglike spirits come from
“the great river Euphrates,” whose waters represent the “peoples, multitudes,
nations, and tongues” that support the harlot (Revelation 17:15).
Again, the third froglike spirit speaking globally through the lips of a
“false prophet” suggests a gigantic system of false prophecy that even now
“covers the land.” In contrast to the lies of the three frogs is Heaven’s
counter-message of the three angels which tell the truth “to every nation,
tribe, tongue, and people” (see Revelation 14:6-12). Study carefully: It’s
the three frogs against the three angels.
The third frog of false prophecy is now teaching a secret rapture, sevenyear
tribulation, future antichrist, literal drying up of a literal Euphrates, and
a literal Middle-East Armageddon involving literal armies attacking literal
Jews. Dear friend, this is all false prophecy. It is part of “the wine” of Babylon,
which deceives all nations (Revelation 14:8; 18:23). In the New Testament,
Jesus used the phrase “new wine” to represent His pure teaching while “old
wine” symbolized the false doctrines of the Pharisees (see Luke 5:36-39).
Wine confuses the mind. In Revelation, the “wine of Babylon” represents the
tantalizing potion of end time delusions with which Mystery Babylon confuses
and dupes the world. Much of this wine concerns Israel. That’s one reason
why the harlot is called a counterfeit “Mystery.” She denies “the mystery of
Christ” we read about earlier. She has rebuilt a wall between Jews and
Gentiles—a wall Jesus Christ smashed into pieces at the cross (see Ephesians
2:14-17). Paul plainly predicted that the time would come when the majority
would “turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables”
(2 Timothy 4:3-4). The clock has struck twelve. We are now living in the
time of frogs and fables.
Have you read the fairytale of a handsome prince who was turned into
a frog? In this ancient story, the frog-prince still had the power of speech.
One day the unfortunate frog happened to meet a beautiful princess. He
opened his mouth, spoke, and convinced the maiden to give him a kiss.
Presto! The frog became a prince again. What is the moral of this story for
us today? The moral is that if we have come under the subtle influence of
frogs and fables, it is high time to return to the Prince. We need the kiss of
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
192
royalty. The Bible says, “Kiss the Son” (Psalm 2:12). Through the words of
truth that fall from the lips of the Truth Teller, we can be delivered from the
third frog of false prophecy.
“And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew,
Armageddon” (Revelation 16:16). This is the only time the exact word
Armageddon is used in the Bible. The truth is, there is no literal place called
“Armageddon” anywhere in the world. This mysterious term is a combination
of two words: (1) Ar, which means “mountain,” and (2) mageddon, reminiscent
of the ancient valley of Megiddo (see 2 Chronicles 35:22). In the
Old Testament, Megiddo was a place of fierce battles and bloody slaughters.
In fact, many scholars suggest the literal meaning of Megiddo is “slaughter” or
“cut off.” Thus the mysterious word, Armageddon, could literally mean a
“mountain” of “slaughter” upon which God’s enemies are “cut off.”
In Daniel 2, a “mountain” is used symbolically to refer to the global kingdom
of God which will one day “fill the whole earth” (Daniel 2:35,44-45).
In Revelation 16:14, we read about a global gathering of “the kings of the
earth and of the whole world” to the final battle. These worldwide forces of
satan compose his global kingdom which will entirely be gathered to
“Armageddon,” to the mountain of slaughter. We conclude that
“Armageddon” refers to a worldwide battle in which satan’s global kingdom
will finally be slaughtered by the approaching Kingdom of God Almighty.
The actual slaughter of satan’s global kingdom is described immediately
after “Armageddon” is mentioned. Read it for yourself: “And they
gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon. Then
the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came
out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, ‘It is done!’ And
there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great
earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since
men were on the earth. Now the great city was divided into three parts,
and the cities of the nations fell. And great Babylon was remembered
before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.
Then every island fled away, and the mountains were not found”
(Revelation 16:16-20). Contrary to the all-pervasive teaching of the third
frog, these words clearly describe divine wrath upon spiritual Babylon and
a global slaughter that reaches far beyond the Middle East.
Prior to Armageddon, the three froglike spirits “go out to the kings of
the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great
day of God Almighty” (Revelation 16:14). John wrote in a parallel passage,
“I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to
make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army”
(Revelation 19:19, emphasis added). Who is the gathering at Armageddon

really against? Literal Jews? No! It is a gathering of the world forces of
Mystery Babylon against the Warrior on the horse and against His army. The
Warrior is King Jesus (see Revelation 19:11), but what about His army? Who
will compose that holy battalion? It will be an army of “legions of angels”
(Matthew 26:53) who return with King Jesus at His second coming (see
Matthew 16:27; 24:31).
The following passage describes the actual battle of Armageddon, the
victory of King Jesus, the doom of Hell’s Mistress, and the final slaughter of
all the “nations” who have been duped by lucifer’s lying legionnaires. Read it
reverently with a humble heart:
Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He
who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness
He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and
on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no
one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in
blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies
in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him
on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that
with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule
them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the
fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe
and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS, AND
LORD OF LORDS (Revelation 19:11-16).
On the morning of September 11, Steve Miller was inside the fully
intact South Tower of the World Trade Center just minutes after the North
Tower burst into flames. As he and his associates descended from the 80th
floor, he paused on the 55th floor to use the men’s room. It was shortly after
9:00 am. Shall I phone my wife? he pondered. Suddenly a voice echoed over
the PA system—“Don’t panic. The building is safe. Return to your offices.”
As Mr. Miller glanced sideways at the flaming building right next door and
saw people jumping from windows a thousand feet above the ground, his
innate distrust of official voices won out. He made a bolt for the stairs just as
a second plane exploded into the South Tower a few floors above him. He
ran outside, and as he hurried across the bridge toward Brooklyn, he looked
back just in time to see his building vanish in a cloud of smoke. Upon his
arrival at home his teary-eyed wife collapsed into his arms. “Oh, my God,”
she cried, “I thought you were dead.”
As we approach “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”
(Revelation 16:14), my earnest appeal to you is: Don’t trust every officialsounding
voice you hear, or you may end up dead. There are times when we
must go against the grain, in the opposite direction of the crowd. Sincere

prophecy teachers who now advocate preterism or futurism (with its focus on
literal Israel) may say, “Don’t panic. Our theories are safe. Stay in the building.”
But the fact is, someday both towers of prophetic error will be totally
vaporized.
In spite of Revelation’s description of a global slaughter, the bottomline
message of Armageddon is good news. Heaven’s encouragement is:
The world forces of satan’s kingdom will one day come crashing down
around the world. So take heart! The Rider on the white horse—whose
name is Faithful and True—will win. “The meek shall inherit the earth,
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace” (Psalm 37:11).
God’s love shall endure forever, and some day “there shall be no more
death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former
things have passed away. Then He who sat on the throne said, ‘Behold, I
make all things new.’ And He said to me, ‘Write, for these words are true
and faithful’ ” (Revelation 21:4-5).
In the midst of Armageddon’s ruins will lie the third frog of false
prophecy. That frog will never become a prince. But we can! As Steve
Miller’s wife fell into the arms of her husband, so should we fall right
now into the loving arms of Jesus Christ and let His grace kiss new life
into our souls.
Let’s forsake all frogs and fables as we follow the King.
Frogs, Fables, and Armageddon

Chapter 32
Thunder From Heaven?s Temple
The Ten Commandments are the divinely revealed law.
It’s time for Christians to take a stand.
— Roy Moore (1947-)
Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice
“And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew,
Armageddon. Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and
a loud voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, ‘It is
done!’ And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was
a great earthquake” (Revelation 16:16-18). Immediately after Armageddon
is mentioned, the next verse shines the spotlight on “the temple of heaven.”
There are noises, thunderings, lightnings, and a great earthquake. God is
definitely trying to get our attention. His thunderous message is, “Look to
the heavenly temple!”
The third frog wants us to gaze in the opposite direction, toward a
third temple on earth. It’s a strategy called diversion. In 1991, during
Operation Desert Storm, the allies built up their forces just east of Iraq in
the Persian Gulf. Saddam Hussein thought an attack was coming from the
east, but the allies hit from the west. Their maneuver was successful
because Saddam wasn’t looking in that direction. Today, the third frog is
doing the same thing. He wants us to look in the wrong direction toward a
rebuilt third temple on earth. If we follow his croaking counsel, we will fail
to discern life-saving truths coming from a different point of the compass.
Again John wrote, “The temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark
of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, noises,
thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail” (Revelation 11:19). Here are the
197
same glorious manifestations of God’s power we just read about in Revelation
16:18, yet now these fireworks are connected with the seeing of the heavenly
“ark of His covenant.” Millions have seen the movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark,
where Indiana Jones found the lost ark of the covenant. That movie is fantasy,
while Revelation is reality. Because of the third frog’s strategy of diversion, the
knowledge of the heavenly ark has been lost. But prophecy says it will be
regained and “seen” by those who search hard for this truth.
The same manifestations of God’s power described in Revelation
occurred when the Almighty descended on Mount Sinai to give the Ten
Commandments (see Exodus 19:16-18; 20:1-17). The Ten Commandments
are called “tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger
of God” (Exodus 31:18). After Moses received those rugged rocks, he “came
down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark” (Deuteronomy
10:5). Because those unique, God-authored tablets were placed inside the
ark, that special, gold-covered box was called “the ark of the Testimony”
(Exodus 40:20- 21).
Revelation 11:19 says, “The temple of God was opened in heaven, and
the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple.” Inside that ark are the original
Ten Commandments. Here is a mighty truth God wants to be “seen,” yet
the devil is determined to blind us, and this is the reason for his diversion
strategy. Through the third frog of false prophecy, the enemy seeks to divert
our minds toward a rebuilt third temple on earth. Why? Because there’s no ark
there! If we follow his croaking counsel, we will look in the wrong direction,
bypass Heaven’s temple, and fail to discern the end time significance of the
Ten Commandments.
Mystery Babylon has not only rebuilt a wall between Jews and Gentiles,
but she often teaches that the Ten Commandments were given only for
Israel, not the Church. But Jesus Christ, the Rock of the Church, boldly testified:
“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did
not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and
earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till
all is fulfilled. Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments,
and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom
of heaven” (Matthew 5:17-19). Did you catch that? Here the Master Teacher
said we should “do” and “teach” the “commandments”—and not even “break
one” of them!
A few verses later, Jesus specifically quoted the seventh commandment:
“You shall not commit adultery” (Matthew 5:27). Then the
Pure One commented, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has
already committed adultery with her in his heart” (verse 28). Here Jesus
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
198
plummeted the spiritual depths of the seventh commandment, and He
also applied it to “whoever,” meaning everyone. In a time of exploding
Internet pornography, widespread proliferation of adult videos, sex
scandals, flesh-flaunting TV programs, and marital unfaithfulness,
shouldn’t God’s Church be emphasizing the seventh commandment?
Jesus also rebuked some tricky Pharisees for their subtle practice of skirting
around God’s fifth commandment, which states, “Honor your father and
your mother” (Matthew 15:4). Christ pointedly declared, “Thus you have
made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition” (Matthew
15:6). In this dark hour when children often rebel against mom and dad, and
when one rock-and-roll group sings, “Kids, kill your parents,” shouldn’t God’s
Church be proclaiming the fifth commandment also?
If you look carefully, Jesus Christ and the New Testament uphold every
one of the Ten Commandments originally stated in Exodus 20. Pick up your
Bible and read for yourself: Put God first (see Matthew 4:10); No idols (1
John 5:21; Revelation 22:15); Respect God’s name (Romans 2:24); Keep the
Sabbath holy (Matthew 12:12; Luke 23:56); Honor your parents (Matthew
15:4; Ephesians 6:1-3); Do not murder (Matthew 19:18; 1 John 3:15); Do not
commit adultery (Matthew 5:27-28; Galatians 5:19); Do not steal (Mark
7:22; Ephesians 4:28); Do not lie (Romans 13:9; Revelation 21:8); Do not
covet (Luke 12:15; 1 Corinthians 6:12).
It’s a fact; Jesus Christ stood up for the Big Ten and rebuked others
for breaking them. Yet today many professed Christians pit Christ against
the Law, even though Jesus specifically said, “Do not think that I came to
destroy the Law…” (Matthew 5:17, emphasis added). Are they referring to
the Jesus of the New Testament? Well might we ask, “Will the real Jesus
please stand up?” The Ten Commandments are unchangeable; that’s why
God inscribed them with His Almighty finger on solid rock. Have you
heard the expression, “We can change this or that, for it’s not written in
stone”? This illustration stems from the Ten Commandments. In other
words, what’s on stone can’t be altered.
James wrote to Christians, “For whoever shall keep the whole law, and
yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. For He who said, ‘Do not commit
adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ Now if you do not commit adultery,
but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law” (James 2:10-
11). Look closely and think about it. How can a New Testament Christian
“become a transgressor of the law” if it doesn’t exist anymore? Can a speeding
driver receive a ticket for transgressing a speed law that doesn’t exist? Of
course not! Speed laws do exist, and if we will but slow down to read carefully
the words of Jesus Christ and of James, we’ll discover that the Ten
Commandments still exist and apply to Christians.
Thunder From Heaven’s Temple
199
Paul is clear that Christians are not saved by the Law, but by the grace
of Jesus Christ. “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not
of yourselves; it is the gift of God” (Ephesians 2:8). Again, we are “justified
by faith apart from the deeds of the law” (Romans 3:28). Yet Paul is equally
clear that the Big Ten remain and have a purpose. What is this purpose? Paul
declared: “By the law is the knowledge of sin” (Romans 3:20). “I had not
known sin, but by the law” (Romans 7:7 KJV). “…that sin through the commandment
might become exceedingly sinful” (Romans 7:13). God’s Law
makes our sin and inner darkness rise before our faces so that it becomes serious
and “exceedingly sinful” to our astonished eyes. And the Law’s ability to
do this is immeasurably strengthened when we realize God wrote Ten
Commandments, not Ten Suggestions.
The Law is like a mirror. When people crawl out of bed in the morning
and look at the glass they often hate what they see. Yet the mirror is important.
We need to look at it. It’s the same with God’s Law. If we have the courage to
look, we may not like what we see, but this painful and eye-opening revelation
will cause us to feel our desperate need for Jesus Christ’s cleansing blood. In
fact, without His blood, we’re condemned, damned, doomed, and under the
penalty of Divine wrath (see Romans 2:5; 3:19; 4:15; 5:9). “Moreover the law
entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much
more abound” (Romans 5:20, emphasis added). “Wherefore the law was our
schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith”
(Galatians 3:24, KJV). The broken Law leads us to hide in the perfect righteousness
of Jesus Christ alone (see Philippians 3:9).
The good news is, “Christ died for our sins” (1 Corinthians 15:3).
What are “our sins”? Heaven’s answer is, “Sin is the transgression of the
law” (1 John 3:4 KJV ). When we look at God’s Law we see our sin and discern
what slew our Savior. Almost two thousand years ago, on the crest of
a hill called Calvary, the innocent Lamb of God became guilty. He experienced
our sins of breaking the Ten Commandments. “Our sins” entered
His mind and pierced His heart! He felt the sword of God’s wrath (see
Zechariah 13:7)—the full execution of His justice against transgression.
Moved by incomprehensible love, Jesus absorbed our death sentence. He
paid the full price for breaking God’s Law. It’s true. Jesus Christ died on
Mount Calvary because we broke the Ten Commandments given on
Mount Sinai. The evangelical book, Revival’s Golden Key, by Ray Comfort
with Kirk Cameron, supports this view fully, for it has as its entire theme
the forgotten authority of God’s Ten Commandment Law and its inseparable
connection to the grace of Jesus Christ. 146
God gave another law on Mount Sinai that concerned His earthly
temple and the dripping blood of animals. That law involved “sacrifice
and offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin” (Hebrews 10:8; see also
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
200
Hebrews 10:1). Paul said it was this very “[sacrificial] law of commandments
contained in ordinances” that formed “the middle wall of separation”
between Jews and Gentiles (Ephesians 2:14-16). When Jesus died,
He caused “the sacrifice…to cease” (Daniel 9:27, KJV). He took that law
of sacrifices, and “nailed it to the cross” (Colossians 2:14). But that law
was not the Ten Commandments. The Big Ten are eternal, were written
on solid rock, and are now inside the heavenly ark (see Revelation 11:19).
Modern “Babylon,” which means “confusion,” has not only rebuilt a wall
between Jews and Gentiles, but it has also mistakenly nailed the wrong law
to the cross.
Read prayerfully these sobering words from Protestant John Wesley,
founder of the Methodist Church:
“There is, therefore, the closest connection that can be
conceived, between the law and the gospel. On the one
hand, the law continually makes way for, and points us to,
the gospel; on the other, the gospel continually leads us to a
more exact fulfilling of the law…In the highest rank of the
enemies of the gospel of Christ are they who openly and
explicitly ‘judge the law’ itself, and ‘speak evil of the law;’
[see James 4:11], who teach men to break (to dissolve, to
loose, to untie the obligation of) not one only, whether of
the least or of the greatest, but all the commandments at a
stroke….The most surprising of all the circumstances that
attend this strong delusion, is that they are given up to it,
really believing that they honor Christ by overthrowing His
law, and that they are magnifying His office while they are
destroying His doctrine! Yea, they honor Him just as Judas
did when he said, ‘Hail, Master, and kissed Him.’ And He
may as justly say to every one of them, ‘Betrayest thou the
Son of man with a kiss?’ It is no other than betraying Him
with a kiss, to talk of His blood, and take away His crown; to
set light by any part of His law, under pretense of advancing
His gospel. Nor indeed can anyone escape this charge, who
preaches faith in any such a manner as either directly or
indirectly tends to set aside any branch of obedience: who
preaches Christ so as to disannul, or weaken in any wise, the
least of the commandments of God.”147
“God is not the author of confusion” (1 Corinthians 14:33). In order to
overcome the tricks of Revelation’s temptress, we must accept the words of
Jesus Christ (see Matthew 5:17-19), of Paul (see Romans 3:19-20; 7:7,12-13),
of James (see James 2:10-12), and of John (see 1 John 3:4) regarding the continuing
authority of the Ten Commandments. We must look square into the
Thunder From Heaven’s Temple
201
Big Ten and realize we’re doomed without the blood of Jesus. Losing all
self-confidence, and motivated by Christ’s love and sacrifice, we must
yield to the Spirit’s wooing, repent of our sins, and trust fully in the merits
of our Savior. Then we have the promise of full forgiveness for all our
sins. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). The Lamb
Himself will wash us from all filthiness “in His own blood” (Revelation
1:5) and clothe us with “white garments” (Revelation 3:18); the “white
robes” of His own spotless righteousness (Revelation 7:9).
Through the power of the Holy Spirit—now that we have a fresh
start—we are enabled to keep God’s Law (see Romans 8:4). Jesus said, “If you
love Me, keep My commandments” (John 14:15)—a direct quote from the
second commandment (compare with Exodus 20:6). In fact, Christ Himself
is the One who—in His pre-Bethlehem state—originally led the Israelites
from Egypt and who wrote the Big Ten on stone (compare 1 Corinthians
10:1-4; John 1:1-3; 8:58; Exodus 3:14). His Law reflects His character.
This brings us to the heart of the great divide that will ultimately
separate God’s Israel in the Holy Spirit from the flesh-ways of the Scarlet
Harlot. It’s a moral issue. The issue is: Love for Jesus Christ practically
demonstrated by the Spirit-prompted keeping of the Ten Commandments
now housed in Heaven’s ark. In Revelation, this issue is symbolically represented
as being shouted to the whole world by an angel, specifically, by
one called “the third angel.” “And the third angel followed them, saying
with a loud voice….Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation
14:9,12 KJV). This exact issue is repeated in Revelation 12:17 and 22:14
(KJV). It will be understood by all who avoid the third frog’s diversion
strategy, who look to the right temple, and whose Spirit-enlightened eyes
discern the heavenly ark (see Revelation 11:19).
The true “Israel of God” (Galatians 6:16) forgiven by “the Lamb of
God” (John 1:29) will focus on “the temple of God” (Revelation 11:19) and
will keep “the commandments of God” (Revelation 14:12) by “the Spirit of
God” (Romans 8:9,14) as it journeys toward what Jesus Christ called “the
city of My God, the New Jerusalem” (Revelation 3:12).
Don’t let the third frog lead you from the third angel to an imaginary third
temple that has no ark.

Chapter 33
144,000 Israelites Indeed
We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark.
The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.
— Plato (427-347 B.C.)
“The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with
the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have
the testimony of Jesus Christ” (Revelation 12:17 KJV). “Here is the patience
of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the
faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12 KJV). Just as a “remnant” of ancient Israel
came out of literal Babylon and rebuilt a second temple (Haggai 1:12), even
so will a final “remnant” of spiritual Israel come out of spiritual Babylon in
order to keep the Ten Commandments now housed safely inside the ark in
Heaven’s temple (see Revelation 11:19).
God’s final remnant is referred to in prophecy as the 144,000 (see
Revelation 14:1-5). They are described as coming from “all the tribes of the
children of Israel” (Revelation 7:4). Does this mean they are all literal Jews?
Millions think so. Some popular teachers liken this group to “144,000 Jewish
Billy Grahams” who will evangelize the world during the tribulation after the
rapture. But is this right? We have previously seen that Paul wrote that Jews
and Gentiles are now “one” and are part of “the same body” through Jesus
Christ (Ephesians 2:14; 3:4-6). Does the last Book in the Bible contradict
Paul’s writings? Does Revelation rebuild a wall between Jews and Gentiles
that Jesus Christ abolished at the cross? Of course not!
Let’s put on our “New Testament Spirit-glasses” and take a closer look.
The 144,000 are described as standing on “Mount Zion” with the Lamb
(Revelation 14:1). Mount Zion is where Jerusalem sits. Yet in Revelation,
203
“Mount Zion” does not refer to any mountain in the Middle East. John wrote,
“And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and
showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from
God” (Revelation 21:10). As John was “in the Spirit,” even so must we be
“in the Spirit” in order to see the truth about Mount Zion and the 144,000.
Paul told believers, “But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem…to the general assembly and church of
the firstborn who are registered in heaven” (Hebrews 12:22-23). Thus there
is a heavenly Mount Zion on which the New Jerusalem sits. It is the home of
the Church. And this is where John saw the 144,000.
In the New Testament, James wrote his letter “to the twelve tribes
which are scattered abroad” (James 1:1). Who were these twelve tribes? In
the next sentence James called them, “My brethren.” Then he wrote to them
about “the testing of [their] faith” (James 1:3). Thus, these “twelve tribes,”
which James wrote to as a unit, were believers in Christ. In the same letter,
he counseled those from among these “twelve tribes” who were sick to “call
for the elders of the church” for special prayer (James 5:14). Thus to James,
the “twelve tribes” were definitely part of the Church.
The 144,000 “follow the Lamb wherever He goes” (Revelation 14:1,4).
Therefore they are Christians who love Jesus. They are “not defiled with
women, for they are virgins” (Revelation 14:4). This does not mean the
144,000 is composed of only literal, Jewish, unmarried, or celibate men. If
so, this would be teaching mass celibacy, a dogma which Paul called a “doctrine
of demons” (1 Timothy 4:1-3). In 2 Corinthians 11:2, Paul also used
the word “virgin,” and he applied it to the Church. What about the 144,000
not being “defiled with women”? This is talking about the harlot ladies of
Revelation 17.
The truth is that the 144,000 represent a final remnant of God’s
Israel in the Spirit, composed of believing Jews and Gentiles, who are not
“defiled” by the deceptions and false prophecies of the mother and daughters
of Mystery Babylon (see Revelation 17:5). The reason Revelation
refers to them as coming from “all the tribes of the children of Israel” is
because, in the process of exiting modern Babylon, all deception, and even
their own personal sins, they have gone through a similar “wrestling experience”
with the Lord as did Jacob when his name was changed to Israel
(see Genesis 32:24-28).
At the beginning of this “Israel Delusions” section we learned that the
name “Jacob” literally meant “crook” or “deceiver.” This name was an accurate
description of Jacob’s character. He purposefully lied to Isaac three times
(see Genesis 27:19-24) and then stole his father’s final blessing from his older
brother Esau. As a result of his wicked deception, Jacob went into exile for
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS
204
20 years. On his way back home, he discovered Esau was coming with 400
men to meet him (see Genesis 32:6). Filled with guilt, shame, and terror,
Jacob feared his life would be snuffed out because of his sin.
Then came that lonely night of wrestling with the Angel of God.
Finally, just before dawn, Jacob gave up on himself, repented of his sin, and
firmly gripped the heavenly Messenger, saying, “I will not let You go unless
You bless me!” (Genesis 32:26) Then came this response from the Angel:
“Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled
with God and with men, and have prevailed” (verse 28). Through
repentance, humility, and faith, Jacob overcame his naturally deceptive
nature. God gave him a new heart, a new name, a new character. He had
gained the victory.
That very experience that transformed Jacob into a “spiritual Israel” is
a type of the transforming experience that will produce the 144,000. This is
a deep thought, yet it’s true. This insight is more significant than the rediscovery
of the Titanic’s sunken hull. And it applies to us. By nature we all are
like Jacob—sinful, crooked, and deceptive. Maybe, while reading this book,
you have discovered that you yourself have unwittingly deceived others
about Bible prophecy. The thought is terrifying! The Bible says, “A false witness
will not go unpunished, and he who speaks lies will not escape”
(Proverbs 19:5). Just as Esau was coming to meet Jacob, even so does Bible
prophecy predict that God Almighty will eventually come to punish Mystery
Babylon for her lies (see Revelation 18:8). Those who “love and practice a
lie” will unexpectedly find themselves outside the New Jerusalem
(Revelation 22:15). “All liars” will be hurled into the lake of fire (Revelation
21:8). Thus truth versus lies is a life-and-death matter.
Yet Jesus loves us! On a splintery cross His blood dripped down for all
our sins, including our sins of deception. He rose from the dead and ascended
to Heaven. And now, as our merciful High Priest ministering before the
ark in Heaven’s temple, He has given us the Book of Revelation to teach us
the truth. At this very moment, the Good Shepherd is pleading with us to
leave the lies of Mystery Babylon before it’s too late. “Come out of her, My
people,” is His final call from Heaven (Revelation 18:4,8). Soon modern
Babylon will be “utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who
judges her” (Revelation 18:8). She’ll be pulverized.
This is our night for spiritual wrestling, yet soon the darkness will end.
It was at the breaking of the day when the heavenly Messenger finally
touched Jacob’s hip (see Genesis 32:24-25). It was then that Jacob’s selfconfidence
was finally broken as he clung to the Angel of God. So it may
be with us. According to prophecy, we are even now at “the breaking of the
day.” The Son of God is coming soon! Oh, may the Master touch us now
144,000 Israelites Indeed
205
and break us! May the Holy Spirit explode every ounce of wicked pride that
so often pulsates within our sin-clogged mental veins. Following the example
of Jacob, let’s cling to our Savior for our very lives and say, “I will not
let You go unless You bless me!”
As with Jacob, if we humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and depend
entirely upon God’s mercy, the King of Israel will not forsake us. If in simple
faith we lay hold of His perfect righteousness, Jesus will forgive us, change us,
and give us a new name. By faith we can hear the Master say, “Your name
shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God
and with men, and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:28). Jesus is the true Seed of
Abraham, the Victorious One. Through faith in Him, God will cause “us to
triumph in Christ” (2 Corinthians 2:14). Through the Truth Teller, we can
escape the deadly distortions of Mystery Babylon. Through God’s boundless
grace, we can each become, like Jacob, a spiritual Israel.
The Bible specifically says about the 144,000: “In their mouth was
found no guile [deception]: for they are without fault before the throne of
God” (Revelation 14:5 KJV). Like Nathanael, they are “Israelite[s] indeed, in
whom is no deceit!” (John 1:47) They overcome Hell’s Harlot, her deceptions,
and her false prophecies. The 144,000 are like Jacob. They prevail over
their own deceptive natures through the grace of Heaven’s Lamb.
The above passage in Revelation 14:5 about the 144,000 finds its root
in the Old Testament. “The remnant of Israel shall do no unrighteousness
and speak no lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth”
(Zephaniah 3:13). Thus the final remnant of Israel will be made up of people
who speak the truth. They must be one with Jesus Christ, who is “the Truth”
(John 14:6). They must also be guided by “the Spirit of truth” (John 16:13).
Composed of Jews and Gentiles who believe in the Messiah, they will be
God’s final Israel in the Spirit. It is my personal opinion that the number
“144,000” is symbolic. Yet whether literal or symbolic, I hope we will all “be
in that number, when the saints go marching in.”
End Time Delusions is like a heat-seeking missile whose purpose is to
explode deception. As it flies on its mission, its intention is not to promote
anti-Semitism against Jewish people, or to offend sincere Bible-believing
Christians. Rather, its goal is to illuminate minds and save souls. At this very
moment, the Christian Church is filled with gigantic misinterpretations of
prophecy—about the rapture, Daniel’s 70th week, the antichrist, and
Israel—which are out of harmony with the true teaching of Jesus Christ and
the New Testament. Massive changes must occur within churches, prophetic
ministries, and seminaries. In order for this to happen, God’s missile must
hit some big targets!
FEND TIME F DELUSIONS

If you have been led to believe all Christians will disappear with a “poof!”
before the tribulation hits, this lie must be unmasked. If you have accepted the
idea that a final Mr. Sinister will literally walk into a rebuilt Jewish temple during
a seven-year showdown, take a seat, and say, “Listen up, I’m God!” this false
theory must be blown up. If you have been taught that Revelation’s statements
about Jerusalem, Mount Zion, the temple, Gog, Magog, Sodom, Egypt,
Babylon, and the Euphrates River apply to those literal places in the Middle
East, these errors must be shattered. If well-meaning people have convinced
you that Armageddon’s major contestants are Russia, China, and the Jewish
State, someone must lock this error into sight within an instrument panel and
push a glowing red button reading, “Launch Missile Now.” It’s time to flee from
all frogs and fables.
Every one of these supposedly unsinkable theories will hit the ice at
Armageddon. They all will sink just like the Titanic. “Abandon ship!” is the
cry from our Captain. “Come out of her, My people” pleads the Heavenly
One (see Revelation 18:4). Instead of looking toward an earthly Jerusalem
south of Haifa and east of Televiv, our focus should be “the holy city, New
Jerusalem” which will someday “come down out of heaven from God”
(Revelation 21:2). Rather than dwelling on the Wailing Wall or Temple
Mount, our vision should center on “the sanctuary” in Heaven, “the true tabernacle”
(Hebrews 8:1-2) where our faithful High Priest now ministers His
crimson blood in our behalf. Jesus is the “Seed of Abraham,” the true Israel
(Isaiah 41:8 KJV; Galatians 3:16). “And if you are Christ’s, then you are
Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). Never
forget these words.
May God help us all to be among Revelation’s final remnant of Israel
in the Spirit of whom it is written, “Here is the patience of the saints; here
are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus”
(Revelation 14:12). According to the Lord’s “sure word of prophecy” (2
Peter 1:19 KJV), such a commandment-keeping remnant will exist right
before the return of Jesus Christ on a “white cloud” (Revelation 14:14-16).
They will be ready for the descent of the Son of Man with His “sharp sickle”
(verse 14) and will have an eternal home inside the New Jerusalem
(Revelation 21:9-27).
Charing Cross is the name of a subway station in London. I’m told there
is a cross there, serving as a reference point for travelers. A small child once
lost her way in the big city and sat down on a street corner, weeping. “What’s
wrong, little girl?” asked a passing policeman. “I’m lost! I can’t find my way
home,” the girl sobbed. Willing to take her home himself, the man asked for
her address. She didn’t know. The name of her street? No idea. Her phone
number? “I can’t remember!” the lost girl moaned through her tears.
Frustrated, the policeman finally asked, “Little girl, what do you know?”
144,000 Israelites Indeed
207
After thinking for a moment, the child’s face lit up. “Mister, I know how to
get home from the cross. If you can just take me to the cross, I can find my
home from there!”
Dear friend, it’s the same for us. We must all come to the cross—
Protestants, Catholics, Jewish people, Muslims, preterists, futurists, historicists,
prostitutes, alcoholics, drug addicts, and everyone else. We can
find our way home from there. As we journey towards the New Jerusalem,
our Friend Jesus has made every provision that we shall arrive safely. He
loves us, points out our dangers, reproves, convicts, and purifies (see
Daniel 12:10). Thank the Lord, He has given us “the Spirit of truth” and
His “sure word of prophecy” to guide us on the narrow road (John 16:13;
2 Peter 1:19 KJV; Matthew 7:14).
May Paul’s words apply to us: “But you are not in the flesh but in the
Spirit” (Romans 8:9). Let’s live in the Spirit and interpret prophecy according
to the Spirit. Through God’s grace and the tender love of Jesus Christ, may we
each receive courage and strength to become “an Israelite indeed, in whom
is no deceit” (John 1:47).
In these closing days of darkness before the bursting forth of eternal
day, it is my earnest prayer that God will use End Time Delusions to strike,
penetrate—and illuminate—some very big targets.

End Time Delusions Study Guide
SECTION 1: THE RAPTURE DELUSION
Many Christians have been taught that God’s Church will disappear, be
“caught up,” or raptured, seven years before the loud, visible return of Jesus Christ (His
second coming). According to this theory, it’s a silent rapture first, then seven years
of tribulation, then the second coming. Supposedly, those who miss the rapture will
have a “second chance” to be saved during those future seven years. Does the Bible
really teach this doctrine? Let’s review the key Scriptures that are being used by rapture
teachers to support their own views, and find out if the Scriptures truly support
them, or actually challenge and contradict their theories.
1. 1 Thessalonians 4:16
List three noisy sounds connected with Jesus Christ’s return:
1. ________________________________.
2. ________________________________.
3. ________________________________.
2. 1 Thessalonians 4:17
True believers will then be “_______________________ _____________.”
Does “caught up” necessarily mean disappear without a trace?
Compare with Acts 1:9: “…while they watched, He was ______________________
_____________.” Compare Acts 1:9-11, 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, and Matthew
24:30-31. What can we learn from these Scriptures?
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________________________________
3. 1 Thessalonians 5:2-3
This same “day of the Lord” will come like a “______________ ________ __________
_______________. For when they [the unprepared] say, ‘Peace and safety!’ then
_____________________ _____________________ comes upon them…And they shall
______________ _________________.” Verse 3 shows the “thief” idea doesn’t mean a
silent coming, but a sudden one. Compare 4:17 with 5:3. The saved are
“_________________ __________” while the unprepared shall “not ___________________.”
What can we learn from 5:4-5?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________________________________
213
4. Matthew 24:3-5,11,24
Concerning His return, Jesus Christ warned us four times not to be
“__________________________________.”
5. Matthew 24:26
What will false teachers say about Christ’s coming?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
6. Matthew 24:27
How will Jesus come?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
7. Matthew 24:40-41
When Jesus comes, “Then two men will be in the field: one will be _____________
and the other ___________________.” Is this a secret “rapture” or the second coming?
Read verses 27,30-31,36-39 carefully to discover the answer. What can we
learn from these verses?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
8. 1 Corinthians 15:52
When Jesus comes, what two things will happen in “the twinkling of an eye”?
1._______________________________________________________________________________________
2. ______________________________________________________________________________________
This occurs when “the __________________ trumpet” sounds. Compare with
1 Thessalonians 4:16 and Matthew 24:31.
Conclusion: Upon careful examination, 1 Thessalonians 4:16–5:3, Matthew
24:36-41, and 1 Corinthians 15:52 do not teach a silent return of Jesus Christ, a
“secret rapture,” or disappearing Christians. Taken in context, they all teach that
true believers will be “caught up” at the loud, noisy, visible, second coming of our
Lord, when “the trumpet sounds,” at “the last trumpet.”
214
SECTION 2: THE TRIBULATION DELUSION
Countless Christians have debated whether Jesus Christ will return before the
seven years of tribulation (the pre-trib position), in the middle of the seven years (the
mid-trib position), or at the end of the seven years (a post-trib position). Those who
adopt the pre-trib view contend that God will remove His people in the rapture so
they won’t have to endure the final “tribulation” at all. Study Guide #2 will attempt
to prove that God’s people have endured and will yet endure “tribulation” until the
end of the world. More importantly, it will demonstrate that there is no future
“seven-year tribulation” at all.
1. Seven Years of Tribulation?:
Search the Bible for this exact phrase. Can you find it? It isn’t there.
Amazingly, the entire theory is based on a highly speculative interpretation of
one verse—Daniel 9:27.
2. Daniel 9:27 literally says:
“And _______shall ________________ the ___________________ with many for ____________
_____________: and in the ___________of the week he shall cause the __________________
and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall
make it _________________, even until the consummation, and that determined shall
be poured out upon the desolate” (Daniel 9:27 KJV).
3. Daniel 9:27 as popularly interpreted:
“He” is the antichrist.
“The covenant” is a peace treaty the antichrist makes with the Jews after
the rapture.
“One week” is the seven-year period of tribulation.
“In the midst of the week” means after three and one-half years.
“He shall cause the sacrifice…to cease” means the antichrist will stop the sacrifices
of the a rebuilt Jewish temple in Jerusalem during the tribulation.
4. Daniel 9:27 as anciently interpreted (see Matthew Henry?s famous Bible
commentary):
“He” is Jesus Christ.
“The covenant” is “the new covenant” which Jesus Christ “confirmed.”
“One week” means “seven years” (see Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34).
“In the midst of the week” means after three and one-half years of holy ministry.
“He shall cause the sacrifice…to cease” occurred when Jesus Christ died. His
death caused the Jewish sacrifices to “cease” to be of value in God’s sight.
215
5. Daniel 9:27 fulfilled by Jesus Christ:
Daniel 9:25-26: Who is the primary subject of these verses? ______________________
Romans 15:8: Jesus came to “__________________ the promises made to the fathers”
(KJV).
Matthew 26:28: “For this is My _____________of the _____________ __________________,
which is shed for _________ for the remission of sins.” Compare with Daniel 9:27.
How long was Jesus Christ’s public ministry? _____________________________________
Matthew 27:51: When Jesus died, what happened to the veil of the Jewish
temple? Why? ________________________________________________________________________
Hebrews 10:12: Jesus “offered _____________ _____________________ ____________
__________________ forever.”
Matthew 23:38: Jesus said, “See! Your house is left to you ______________________.”
6. God always strengthens His people to endure ?tribulation.?
Read John 16:33; Romans 5:3-5; Acts 14:22; 2 Thessalonians 1:4; Revelation
1:9; 2:9; 7:14, Matthew 24:13; 28:20; Psalm 91. Discuss these verses. What can
we learn from them?_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
Conclusion: The entire “seven-year tribulation theory” is a mega-myth. With
His own precious blood, Jesus Christ Himself “confirmed” the covenant mentioned
in Daniel 9:27. Throughout history, God has always strengthened His Church to
endure tribulation, and He promises to do this until the end.

SECTION 3: THE ANTICHRIST DELUSION
Popular rapture theories teach that “the antichrist” applies to only one
future Mr. Diabolical who shows up after Christians vanish. According to this
view, “the antichrist” isn’t here now, won’t confront the Church, and only
attacks after-the-rapture, new believers.
1. Antichrist? The word “antichrist” is found only five times in the Bible. Contrary
to popular opinion, none of these verses points to a yet-future Mr. Sinister.
1 John 2:18: “…ye have heard that _________________________shall come” (KJV).
1 John 2:18: “…even __________ are there ____________________antichrists” (KJV).
1 John 2:19: “____________went out from _______” (KJV). What does this mean?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
1 John 2:22: “Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is
________________________ who denies the Father and the Son.” Who might this
apply to today? ________________________________________________________________________
1 John 2:26: In John’s day, who were these many “antichrists” trying to
deceive?________________________________________________________________________________
1 John 4:3: Antichrist will not confess that “Jesus Christ has come in the
______________________.”
1 John 4:3: There is a “_________________________ of antichrist.”
1 John 4:3: This spirit is “____________________________in the world.”
1 John 4:4: Who is to overcome antichrist?_________________ How?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
1 John 4:6: The spirit of antichrist is also “the spirit of _________________________.”
2 John 7: He who denies Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is “a deceiver and
__________________ antichrist.”
2. Daniel 7: Although Daniel didn’t use the word, “antichrist,” many of his prophecies
describe things that are antichrist in nature.
7:3-7: Daniel dreamed of four beasts. A _________________, _________________,
___________________, ____________________.
7:23: A beast represents _________________________.
7:7-8: The fourth beast had “_____________ horns.” Then there came up
among them “____________________ _____________________horn” (KJV).
7:8: The little horn had “eyes ____________________ the eyes of ___________________,
and a _____________________ speaking great things” (KJV).
7:21: The little horn “made ____________________with the _____________________, and
prevailed against them” (KJV).
217
3. 2 Thessalonians 2: Paul warned about an “antichrist” of prophecy.
2:1: Jesus Christ is coming to “_____________________________ together” His people.
2:3: Before He comes, there will come “a __________________ _________________first.”
A “falling away” means an apostasy from truth. See 1 Timothy 4:1; 2 Timothy
4:3-4; Revelation 2:4-5.
2:3: In the wake of this “falling away” will come “that __________________of sin…
the ______________________ of perdition.”
Who did Jesus also call a “son of perdition” in John 17:12? What lesson can we
learn from this? _______________________________________________________________________
2:4: Where will this antichrist sit? __________________________________________________
According to 1 Corinthians 3:16, what is “the temple of God”? What lesson
can we learn from this? ______________________________________________________________
2:7: In Paul’s day, “the mystery of lawlessness” was “___________________at work.”
2:8: How long will this mystery of lawlessness work?_____________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
4. Revelation 13: The beast in Revelation 13:1 is the same as the “little horn” in
Daniel 7:8.
13:2: The beast is a combination of what three beasts? ______________________,
_______________________, _______________________.
13:2: Who gives the beast his power and seat? ____________________________________
13:5: The beast has “a ____________________________speaking great things” just like
the little horn.
13:7: The beast makes “war with the _________________” just like the little horn.
13:7: The beast has power over “every ____________________, ____________________,
and _______________________________________.”
Conclusion: When all biblical verses about “antichrist” are examined, it is
clear they do not apply to only one Mr. Deadly who shows up after the rapture. In
John’s day, there were “many antichrists,” and there was also a “spirit of antichrist.”
A careful analysis of Daniel’s “little horn,” Paul’s “mystery of lawlessness,” and John’s
“beast” also point toward something much bigger than simply one evil person who
shows up after we’re gone. Ultimately, “antichrist” is against Jesus Christ and His true
gospel (see 1 John 2:2,18).
218
SECTION 4: THE ISRAEL DELUSION
Fundamental to rapture theology is the supposed distinction between Israel
and the Church. Rapture promoters teach that after the Church is “caught up,” then
God will focus on the Jews. This theory sees physical Israel, a rebuilt Jewish temple,
and a Middle East Armageddon as the final focus of the Book of Revelation. Does
the New Testament and Revelation itself support this doctrine?
1. The first time ?Israel? is mentioned in the Bible:
Genesis 32:28: “Your name shall no longer be called ___________, but ____________.”
This is the first time the word “Israel” is found in Scripture.
Read Genesis 27 and 32:1-28. Why do you think the Angel changed Jacob’s
name to Israel? ________________________________________________________________________
What spiritual lessons can we learn from this?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2. The shocking principle of two Israels: According to the New Testament, there
is not just one Israel, but two! Here’s the proof.
1 Corinthians 10:18: “Behold __________________after the _________________” (KJV).
Romans 9:3-4: “…my countrymen according to the _________________, who are
______________.”
Galatians 6:16: “…the Israel of ______________________”
Romans 9:6: “They are not all ____________________ [of God] who are of
_____________________ [after the flesh].”
That is, not all who are literal Israelites are part of “the Israel of God.”
Compare Romans 9:1-3 to Galatians 6:14-16. What is the difference between
the two Israels? _______________________________________________________________________
Romans 9:8: “…those who are the children of the flesh, these are ____________
the ________________ ______________ ______________.” Only those who are born again
are God’s spiritual children (see John 1:11-13).
Galatians 6:14 (KJV): What does “the Israel of God” glory in?
_________________________________________________________________________________________
Galatians 6:15 (KJV): The issue is not circumcision or uncircumcision, but “a
new _____________________________________.”
3. Jews and Gentiles are part of God?s Israel through Jesus Christ: Paul did not
separate believing Gentiles from believing Jews. Both groups are now one in Jesus
Christ, the true Messiah.
Galatians 3:16: God made promises to Abraham and ____________ _______________,
219
who is _______________.
Galatians 3:29: Paul told Gentiles, “If you are _______________, then you are
______________ _____________.”
Galatians 3:28: “There is neither ______________ nor _____________ ... you are all
____________ in Christ Jesus.”
Romans 11:17: Believing Gentiles are “grafted __________________________________.”
Ephesians 2:11-13: Believing Gentiles are now part of “the commonwealth of
________________________________.”
Ephesians 2:14-15: Jesus broke down “the middle ____________of ________________.”
Ephesians 4:4-6: Jews and Gentiles are now “of ___________________________body.”
4. Israel in Revelation: The focus of the Book of Revelation is Jesus Christ, the
Israel of God, Mystery Babylon, Christ’s heavenly temple, and the New
Jerusalem—not physical Israel in the Middle East.
Revelation 1:1: The Book is primarily “the revelation of ________________________.”
Revelation 3:12: Jesus called the “_______Jerusalem” the “city of _______________.”
Revelation 7:4: “…all the tribes of the children of ______________________________.”
Revelation 11:19: “The _________________ of God was opened in __________________”
(see 13:6; 15:5; 16:1).
Revelation 17:5: “MYSTERY, ___________________________ THE GREAT.”
Revelation 16:16-19: After Armageddon (16), “the temple of __________________” (17)
is mentioned and “great______________________” (19) collapses.
Conclusion: The New Testament’s focus is Jesus Christ, the primary “seed”
of Abraham (Galatians 3:16), “the Israel of God” (Galatians 6:16) composed of
both Jews and Gentiles who believe in Christ (Galatians 3:28-29), “the temple of
God in heaven” (Revelation 11:19), and the “New Jerusalem” (Revelation 3:12;
21:10)—not “Israel after the flesh” (1 Corinthians 10:18) or earthly Jerusalem
(see Galatians 4:22-31).

Forward
Published works that speak with compelling eloquence do not need introductions; they
constitute their own introductions. Such is the case with respect to Samuel Koranteng-Pipim's
Receiving the Word.
Therefore, instead of employing this page to highlight the merits of this timely work, I will
direct my comments to the author himself, commending him for his courage in writing this
book and alerting him to the kinds of interesting reactions his work is likely to generate. I
offer my comments from the vantage point of one who has been closely acquainted with the
author in his evangelistic work in Africa, Europe, and North America:
Samuel, at a time when some prefer not to debate issues, your book evidences that: (1) you
prize the quest for biblical truth over the pursuit of theological tranquility; (2) you neither
believe in the myth of theological neutrality nor the political expediency that encourages it;
and consequently, (3) you have chosen not to maintain the status quo of silence on the
divisive issue of biblical authority and interpretation. These characteristics of your work make
it invaluable for anyone seeking to understand some of the current theological developments
in the Seventh-day Adventist church.
But in today's climate of theological pluralism and its culture of indifference to truth, you
need to be reminded that those who dare to call others to biblical accountability, particularly
on forbidden issues, are seldom tolerated. Thus, while your book will be a blessing to
thousands of earnest truth-seekers, you must also expect some negative reactions against your
work, and even against yourself. Such a barrage would be mounted even if Receiving the
Word had not been written by an African. For whenever error is exposed, it always finds ways
to vent its wrath against the message and the messenger of truth.
With this in mind, I urge you to take counsel from advice given by William W. Adams to
Mr. Robert Shank some three decades ago. These words are memorialized in the introduction
to Shank's provocative book against the long held position of "once saved always saved" (see
Robert Shank's Life in the Son [Springfield, Missouri: Westcott Publishers, 1961], xviii-xix).
To personalize the advice, I will replace Mr. Shank's name with your own:
"Samuel, unless human nature has recently and radically changed, there are some who will
do their utmost to give your book the 'silent' treatment. Some will be too learned to
acknowledge that they have not known all there is to know on the subject. They will consider
that their first obligation is to their personal academic reputation and professional interests.
With great scholarly dignity, they will carefully ignore your book.
"Some will loudly denounce your book merely because you dare to call in question some
of their customary interpretations and to challenge their accustomed doctrinal position. They
will label you a heretic or a novice. Let me urge you to ignore all criticisms of yourself, and
all criticisms of your book that amount to mere general disapproval and denunciation. This
will be the resort only of men who are incapable of presenting any serious reply to your
interpretations and thesis. Negative criticisms that fail to demonstrate objectively that your
interpretations are incorrect will not deserve serious consideration or serve the cause of truth.
"Some will consider that 'unity' is more important than truth and that, right or wrong,
conformity to tradition and popular opinion is the only wise course. Men so easily become
enslaved by vested interest in the status quo, and many will refuse to venture the risk of
honestly searching for the truthat the possible expense of comfort.
"Some, thank God, will read your book with growing provocation and an insatiable hunger
and determination to see the study through to a conclusion that is unquestionably Biblical.
They are the ones (I pray they may be many) who will profit from the reading of your book
and form an honest effort to refute it. Whatever the ultimate verdict, their knowledge of the
4
Scriptures will be increased and their lives and Christian witness will be enriched because of
your book.
"Samuel, there may be other responses to your book which neither you nor I can foresee.
But this much is assured: all genuine scholars and searchers after truth will be compelled to
take your book into consideration."
My earnest prayer is that every reader of Receiving the Word will be led to take an
uncompromising stand for God's truth--no matter the cost. It is this truth alone which can
truly set us free (John 8:32).
Thank you, Samuel, for challenging us to receive the Word and live by it.

To The Reader
Receiving the Word has an innocent title; but it deals with an explosive issue--biblical
inspiration and interpretation and their impact on our faith and practice. Since the subject
matter is contentious, readers must be aware of the two dangers confronting anyone who
seeks to address the issue. On the one hand is the risk of becoming cowardly, hesitant,
people-pleasing, waffling, and compromising. On the other hand lies the danger of becoming
headstrong, judgmental, unkind, abrasive and dogmatic. In the name of "love," the first option
risks not speaking the truth; in the name of "truth," the second fails to speak in love.
In this book we have done our best to speak the truth in love. Still, we anticipate varied
reactions to this work. For those unaware of the internal sophisticated challenge to our
distinctive doctrines and lifestyle, this book will be a disturbing eye-opener. For those seeking
to understand the underlying causes of recent theological conflicts in the Seventh-day
Adventist church, this volume will provide a probing explanation. For those who believe in
the "progressive" ideas of theological liberalism and its method of higher criticism, this book
will present a biblically compelling alternative. And for those who have always accepted the
Bible as God's inspired, trustworthy, and solely-authoritative Word, this work will be
reassuring.
Receiving the Word adopts a serious tone, bringing a probing style to this sensitive issue.
The following paragraphs will explain why.
Immediate Context
One of the best things to happen to the Seventh-day Adventist church in recent times has
been the intense discussion over such issues as abortion, polygamy, divorce and remarriage,
fighting in wars, women's ordination, and homosexuality. These discussions have brought
into the open a major crisis that has been ignored and even denied during the past several
decades.
This crisis has to do with the conflicting views within the church over the nature, authority,
and interpretation of the Scriptures. It has divided North American Bible scholars into
"conservative" and "liberal" camps. The issue has also created conservative and liberal
Adventist institutions, influenced by their respective thought leaders.
A Divisive Issue. Because of the polarization between theological conservatives and
liberals, a cordial but uneasy fiction exists among our pastors, administrators, and
theologians. Although they belong to the same church, institution, ven theological faculty,
and although they are pleasant and amiable whenever they meet, yet there is a great gulf that
separates them.
This crisis has also left many students in our institutions confused. It has produced a
generation of preachers, Bible teachers, church leaders, editors and publishers who are unsure
of some of our historic beliefs and practices. It has also shipwrecked the faith of many youth
and new believers, whether they be in Seventh-day Adventist classrooms or churches.
A Forbidden Issue. But despite its baneful results, very few of our Bible scholars are
willing to address candidly this forbidden issue of conflicting methods of Bible interpretation.
Even when they attempt to discuss the cause of their disagreements, they do so only at a
superficial level. In this way, they escape being labeled as "dogmatic," "ultra-conservative,"
or "fundamentalist"1--epithets often hurled at Bible-believing scholars who refuse to adopt the
6
unscriptural views of their "progressive" counterparts.
Moreover, church leaders and institutional heads often hesitate to tackle the forbidden
issue, even when they are aware of how it is eroding confidence in our Bible-based faith and
lifestyle. They fear that Adventist Bible scholars would brand them as reactionary
"theological police officers" slowing down the acceleration of "open-minded investigation of
truth" or even stopping the traffic of "academic freedom" or "freedom of individual
conscience."
A Global Church Issue. As the published works and influence of these North American
thought-leaders are spreading abroad, this contentious issue is threatening to fracture the
worldwide Seventh-day Adventist movement, not along cultural lines, but according to
prevailing attitudes regarding the authority of the Bible. This may explain what some have
perceived as a growing polarization between "the church of the West" and "the rest of the
church."
For example, shortly after the 1995 General Conference session in Utrecht, the
Netherlands, an Adventist scholar in ethics wrote: "The vote refusing the NAD [North
American Division] permission to ordain its women is the real 'tip of the iceberg,' the iceberg
being the clash between scriptural literalism, a view largely held in the developing
world--Africa and much of South America and Inter-America, and a principle-based
approach to Scripture followed in areas where the church has matured for a century and a
half" (i.e., North America, Europe, and possibly Australia). This professor states that "many
African converts, not far removed from bigamous exploitation of women, are naturally drawn
to an interpretation of Scripture ['scriptural literalism'] that affirms a millennia-old sentiment
toward women."2
The undertones of cultural arrogance in the above comment were perhaps unintended. The
same can be said of another article to which the above-cited author directs his readers. The
second writer, until recently the editor of a church publication for pastors, suggested that
those who do not subscribe to the so-called "principle-based approach" cannot handle a high
level of abstract thinking and are comparatively immature:
"Most people have not learned to reason abstractly," he wrote. "This is why the literal
approach is so appealing. Children begin with concrete and literal understandings of life. It is
not until around 10 years and older that they can begin to conceptualize and reason in the
abstract. If people learn only the proof-text method of Bible study they will never develop a
principle-based approach and will always remain children in their understanding. The method
that rules in the coming years will determine whether the Adventist church will continue to
grow and mature or whether it will always remain in an infantile state."3
Statements of this kind from responsible thought leaders of the church raise some crucial
questions.
Critical Questions. What do the expressions "principle-based approach" and "literal
approach" really mean? How are these approaches different from the two conflicting methods
that have polarized Adventist scholars for three decades and more--liberalism'shigher
criticism (the historical-critical method) and the traditional Adventist plain reading of
Scripture (the historical-grammatical method)?4
Should one accept as an established fact the assertion that some parts of the world church
are more "mature" in their understanding of Scripture than others? If so, what is the nature of
this "maturity"?
Can we explain the polarization between "the church of the West" and "the rest of the
church" on certain theological issues on the basis of culture and some undefined concepts of
7
principle versus literal methods of interpreting the Scriptures?
Finally, to what extent do conflicting approaches to Scripture contribute to the identity
crisis in certain parts of the Adventist church? In short, what is really at stake in this crisis
over biblical authority and biblical interpretation?
The Crisis of Identity
The editor of Adventist Review describes the crisis as "The Fragmenting of Adventism."5
On the other hand, an unofficial Adventist publication hails this "fragmentation" as "A
Gathering of Adventisms"--i.e., mainstream, historic, evangelical and progressive
Adventisms.6
Still, Christianity Today, the largest evangelical magazine in the United States, peeked into
our church recently and on seeing the distinct factions and theological conflicts between
"traditionalist," "evangelical," "liberal," and "charismatic" Adventists in North America,
perceptively concluded that our church is experiencing "an identity crisis."7 This article notes
that "the present confusion is in direct contrast to the confidence of Adventism's pioneers,"
who "knew exactly who they were. They were God's 'remnant church.' 'A special people, with
a special message, for a special time!'"8
"What Is Going On?" Formerly, when someone asked "What is going on?" the answers
were: "Jesus, our loving Savior, is coming very soon"; "our Lord and heavenly High Priest is
transforming lives and bringing about revivals in our churches"; "the 'present truth' of the
three angels' messages is being received in all parts of the world."
But today, when someone asks, "What is going on in Adventism?" the response often goes
like this: "Some church scholars are challenging the distinctive doctrines of the church";
"some churches are rebelling against the decision of the worldwide church"; "some church
leaders have lost the courage of biblical convictions"; "some 'reformers' are teaching that the
church has become 'Babylon' or is in apostasy."
The replacement of optimism with pessimism in some parts of the world, together with the
fragmentation of the church, are indications of Adventism's current crisis of identity. Our
General Conference president recently observed: "In many of the more developed and
sophisticated areas of the world, I sense that an increasingly secular value system is
negatively impacting many of our members. I sense a growing uncertainty about why we exist
as a church and what our mission is."9
Our present identity crisis is not only about the nature of worldwide Seventh-day
Adventism, but more significantly about the future of Seventh-day Adventism worldwide.
The crisis is not just about whether it will remain a united church, but more importantly about
whether there will be a church to be united. The crisis facing the church threatens to
undermine the unity, identity, and mission of our church.
Response to the Crisis
The present volume, Receiving the Word, attempts to explain the root cause of the identity
crisis and to explore how it relates to the conflicting views over biblical authority and
interpretation.
Title of Book. Our title comes from Acts 17:11, where Paul commends the Berean
Christians for their fidelity to the written Word. Their example, in that they "received the
Word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were
8
so" (Acts 17:11), suggests that there can be no useful searching of the Scriptures (i.e., no
meaningful interpretation of the Bible) without first receiving the Word as God's inspired,
trustworthy, and authoritative message.
This basic assumption of Christian theology appears in Article 1 of our "Fundamental
Beliefs," which calls upon Seventh-day Adventists to accept the Holy Scriptures, the sixty-six
books of the Old and New Testaments, as God's infallible and authoritative revelation of His
will on every issue of doctrine and practice.
But there are disturbing indications that this important theological foundation of our
church is slowly being chipped away. Already cracks in our theological foundation--our
historic views regarding Scripture's inspiration, trustworthiness and authority--are evident in
the challenges mounted from within against such doctrines as the substitutionary atonement
of Christ, the sanctuary, the church as "the remnant," the Spirit of Prophecy, the second
coming, and the Sabbath.
Another indication of the widening cracks is the confusion in our church over issues such
as the Genesis creation account, homosexuality, abortion, polygamy, women's ordination,
clean and unclean meats, Christian dress, and the use of alcohol.
These uncertainties about theological beliefs and practices may be traced to the inroads of
higher criticism (the historical-critical method of biblical interpretation), which in recent
decades has gained increasing acceptance among many of the church's thought-leaders.
General Unawareness. Unfortunately, many church members and leaders may not even
be aware that our theological house (our doctrinal beliefs and lifestyle) is in trouble, let alone
realize that the cause of the problem is due to cracks in our theological foundation (our view
of, and approach to, inspired Scriptures).
One perceptive scholar explains why this often happens: "The problem is that most
students of the Bible do not have the time to dig into the foundations of the various
approaches [to the Bible]. We are tempted to adopt that approach to the Bible whose visible
structure appeals to us, and to forget that, if we adopt a theology someone else has
constructed without testing the foundation, we do so at our peril."10
Those who realize that cracks exist in our theological foundation generally make either of
two ineffective responses to the problem.
1. Attitude of Indifference. Some exhibit "administrative ostrich-ism," burying their
heads in the sand, pretending that the problem is not real, or even if real, that it will vanish by
default or inaction.
This response forgets that such proverbial ostriches not only bury their heads in the sand
but also lay eggs which will sooner or later hatch into many more ostriches. In other words,
indifference breeds indifference, with fewer and fewer people willing to do something about
the situation.
2. Cosmetic Changes. Instead of mending the cracks in the foundation, some give more
attention to painting the crumbling walls with new and bright colors, re-arranging the
furniture, changing the carpets and curtains, and installing modern technological gadgets to
make the house more comfortable and "user-friendly." Tus, instead of our thought leaders
abandoning the unbiblical method of higher criticism, some simply substitute new names for
this scripturally-discredited method.11
The dangers of this kind of response are like those described in Jesus' parable of the man
who built his house on the sand: "The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew
and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash" (Matt 7:27 NIV).
9
An Alternative Response. This book does not recommend either of these two courses.
Instead, we shall attempt to clear away the sand from the ostrich's head and also seek to go
beyond the cosmetic changes--the theological furnishings, paint, and gadgets. We shall
attempt digging through the dirt to the foundation--what scholars refer to as the assumptions
or presuppositions--and discover the cracks that have resulted as otherwise talented architects
of Adventist theology have slowly chipped away parts of the foundation.
In this effort, we shall seek to spotlight the conflicting methods of biblical interpretation
currently operating in the church, illustrating them with representative published works of
some thought leaders--works which are all in the public arena where they continue to have
influence.12 We shall also point out ways by which the crumbling foundations may be
repaired.
Purpose of Book
General Objective. The apostle Peter urges Christians: "Always be prepared to give an
answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this
with gentleness and respect" (1 Pet 3:15 NIV). Receiving the Word is one Bible student's
answer to the crisis of biblical authority and interpretation in the Seventh-day Adventist
church.
Thus, the book is not simply an attempt to correct misconceptions regarding the approach
to Scriptures supposedly held by Seventh-day Adventists living outside regions where the
church has "matured for a century and a half."13 Rather, it is one Adventist's effort candidly to
address a forbidden issue that has polarized North American Bible scholars for decades into
"liberals" and "conservatives," a growing crisis that is being felt beyond the boundaries of
North America.
In this respect, Receiving the Word may be viewed as a response to a recent call by the
Adventist church to "develop and implement plans to teach the world membership principles
of biblical interpretation," so that pastors and teachers may be encouraged "to make
presentations defending the Bible as authority."14
Specific Objectives. We offer this volume, therefore, to readers with the following
specific objectives:
(1) to create an awareness among Bible-believing Adventists--whether laymembers,
students, or leaders--of the nature and implications of liberalism's approach to Scripture, so
that they may be prepared to respond to it effectively;
(2) to offer some answers to our young people--including students of religion and
theology--who, because of doubts and skepticism created by some of their pastors and Bible
teachers, are presently confused about important issues regarding the authority and
interpretation of the Scriptures; and
(3) to invite Adventist thought leaders who are convinced and crusading advocates of the
contemporary liberal methodologies to reconsider their assumptions and attitudes regarding
God's inspired Word.
Author's Intentions. Pursuing such an investigation has its risks, which may explain why
some responsible scholars and leaders have steered away from this explosive issue. Is it not
more sensible and expedient to go peaefully on with one's life and professional career than to
jump into the midst of a theological storm?
There are times when silence is a betrayal of Christ and His cause. Such is the case with
10
respect to the issue of biblical authority and interpretation. It may be politically expedient to
remain silent; but how can the "theological watchmen of Zion" (cf. Ezek 3:17-21) explain
their silence when the future of God's church is at stake? Can they remain silent when the
historical-critical method continues to ruin the faith of innocent students in the classrooms
and unsuspecting believers in the pews?
Following months of heart-searching, we decided to address this sensitive issue by offering
a biblically persuasive alternative to some of the incorrect or inadequate answers from some
contemporary thought-leaders. We do not offer this book as the last word by an Adventist on
the subject of biblical hermeneutics. Rather, we intend simply to ascertain whether or not our
theological foundations are still sound.
Believing still what we stated in the preface of Searching the Scriptures, that it is better to
discuss an issue without settling it than to settle an issue without discussing it, and believing
also that to disagree with friends is not to dishonor them, we pray that this work will not only
clarify some of the hermeneutical issues behind the church's current crisis of identity, but will
also provide some criteria for evaluating any new approach to biblical interpretation.
Organization
The nature of the subject addressed in Receiving the Word requires that readers not simply
read the book, but that they study, deliberate, and act upon it. With this in view, I have
arranged the main body in three major divisions.
The Main Body. Section I (Chapters 1-3) gives a wider background to the crisis over
biblical authority and interpretation among Seventh-day Adventists. It defines the problem,
illustrates the kinds of responses being offered, and outlines the choices available to Bible
students.
Section II (Chapters 4-6) focuses on the Adventist scene, explaining the nature of the crisis
by documenting the what, who, why, and how of the battle over the Word. It attempts to show
why the new methods of interpretation are leading gradually to a repudiation of our historic
Christian doctrines and practices, and why Bible-believing Adventists must faithfully contend
for the Word. This section will likely generate interesting reactions from readers.
Section III (Chapters 7-12) offers a biblical alternative to the new approaches to Scripture.
It provides answers to some specific questions that often surface in connection with
discussions over the Bible, its transmission, translation, alleged internal contradictions, and
interpretation. It concludes with challenges to all Bible-believing Adventists. In view of the
nature of the material in Sections I and II, readers will find this section to be reassuring.
Source References. I have gathered the ideas reflected in Receiving the Word over a
period of time from many springs of thought--including reading, interaction with students and
teachers, conversations, correspondence, debates with several individuals, and observation at
church and scholarly gatherings. At first, I did not always document the original sources for
the ideas that I later adopted as my own. Thus, though I have tried to give proper credit for all
quotations and ideas used, there are countless individuals whose thoughts I may have
unconsciously echoed in the pages of this volume. If perchance I have used a quotation,
sentene, thought, or expression of someone without giving due credit, I offer my heartfelt
apologies--and thanks!
One final word. Occasional repetitions appear from one chapter to another, because in each
place they augment new arguments. In the words of the Apostle Paul, "It is no trouble for me
to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you" (Phil 3:1, NIV)!
11
Expectation
A critical work of any kind is hardly welcomed, even by those who advocate dialogue and
objectivity in theological inquiry. Anyone who attempts to examine variant theological views
critically in the light of Scripture is often branded divisive, strident, or unkind. This powerful
intimidation factor has muffled the voices of many whose responsibility it is to uphold truth
and expose error.
But is it really divisive, unkind, or unloving to challenge biblically inconsistent views?
Contrary to the assertions of today's champions of theological pluralism, the Bible forbids
exchanging truth for superficial peace or unity; it prohibits substituting the popular and
eloquent speech called silence for the proclamation of truth. Instead, the Bible encourages
believers to "contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints" (Jude 3 NIV).
It urges them to counteract false teaching and false teachers (1 Tim 1:3; 4:1, 6; Titus 1:9-11).
And it calls upon Christians to uphold sound teaching (1 Tim 6:20; 2 Tim 1:13), if they are to
preserve the "unity of faith" (Eph 4:13).
Thus, in epistles written for public reading, the apostle Paul occasionally exposed the false
teachings of certain individuals (1 Tim 1:20; 2 Tim 2:17; 4:10; cf. Phil 4:2-3). John, the
apostle of love, and Jude, the brother of our Lord Jesus Christ, also found it necessary to call
attention to those who were departing from the teachings of the apostles (3 John 9-10; Jude).
These scriptural evidences suggest to Bible-believing Christians the need to "Prove all things;
[and] hold fast that which is good" (1 Thess 5:21).
The example of the Bereans is also noteworthy. They searched the Scriptures critically
before accepting even the inspired theology of Paul (Acts 17:11). When Paul commends them
as noble Christians it suggests to us that "it is a praiseworthy thing to uphold God's truth and
affirm those who accurately proclaim it. On the other hand, it is spiritually lethal to tolerate
false doctrine and apostate teachers--and foolish not to know the difference. But the spirit of
ignorant tolerance that plagues the church today often brands any attempt to scrutinize others'
teaching as narrow-minded, unloving, or divisive. The flip side of tolerance of error is
indifference to truth--and that is disastrous."15
Against this background of indifference to truth, Receiving the Word is being sent forth
with a prayer that it will stimulate and encourage Christians to develop the Berean attitude to
Scriptures--that is, to adopt only those theological methods and views which have passed the
scrutiny of biblical investigation. Such an attitude refuses to succumb either to the flattery or
the coercion of the theological spirit of our age.
At a time when scholars of theological pluralism are applauding the peaceful cohabitation
of truth and error, and at a time when it has become politically expedient for church members
and leaders to adopt postures of theological neutrality, Bible-believing Adventists must join
Ellen G. White in insisting that "light and darkness cannot harmonize. Between truth and
error there is an irrepressible conflict. To uphold and defend the one is to attack and
overthrow the othe" (The Great Controversy, p. 126).

NOTES

1. Although the term fundamentalist is quite elastic, today it is usually a "put-down" for
Bible-believing Christians who reject the higher criticism of theological liberalism. Their
"progressive" counterparts often perceive such Christians as anti-intellectual, reactionary, and
authoritarian. James Barr's suggestion that the word fundamentalism connotes "narrowness,
bigotry, obscurantism, and sectarianism" highlights this point (Barr, Fundamentalism
[Philadelphia, Penn.: Westminster, 1977], p. 2).

principles of ethics and canons of journalism," striving "for fairness, candor, and good taste."

4. The current editors of Adventist Review and Ministry have also suggested that two
conflicting methods of interpretation--"principle-based approach" and "literal approach"--are
operating in the church, although they do not attach undertones of cultural snobbery to their
assertions. See William G. Johnsson, "The Old, the New, and the Crux," Adventist Review,
General Conference Bulletin no. 7, July 7, 1995, p. 3; Will Eva, "Interpreting the Bible: A
Commonsense Approach," Ministry, March 1996, pp. 4-5; cf. Caleb Rosado, "How Culture
Affects Our View of Scripture," Spectrum, December 1995, pp. 11-15. Rosado calls the two
methods "principle/spirit approach" and "literal/letter" approach. Another author refers to the
two conflicting approaches as a clash between the "contextual approach" and the "key-text
approach" (Steve Case, "Thinking About Jewelry: What the Bible (Really) Says," in Shall We
Dance: Rediscovering Christ-Centered Standards, ed. Steve Case [Riverside, Calif.: La Sierra
University Press, 1996], pp. 184-193). For at least 30 years, Seventh-day Adventist scholars
have been polarized into two camps--those who use the methods of higher criticism (the
historical critical method) and those who remain faithful to the church's historic plain reading
method of interpretation (the historical-grammatical method). Among those who have
correctly articulated the issue are William H. Shea, "How Shall We Understand the Bible?"
Ministry, March 1996, pp. 10-13; Robert K. McIver, "The Historical-Critical Method: The
Adventist Debate," Ministry, March 1996, pp. 14-17. Thus, perceptive observers have
justifiably wondered whether the recent "principle" and "literal" approaches are not new
terms for an old conflict between the historical-critical method and the historical-grammatical
method. Subsequent chapters in Receiving the Word will pursue this question further.

12. Those not familiar with scholarly discussions may question the legitimacy of citing
and reviewing published Adventist works. However, references to these published materials
should be seen as objective or scholarly citations, just as one would treat the works of authors
like Rudolf Bultmann or Oswald Chambers, or any other theologian or minister. Taking issue
with such published Adventist works is not the same as questioning the sincerity of the
individuals whose works are cited; neither does it mean an expression of personal dislike for
the authors whose works are being reviewed.
Readers are encouraged to consult the notes not only for the sources cited but, in some
cases, also for counter views by other Adventist scholars. Although many more sources could
have been cited to illustrate the cracks in our theological foundation, we have limited
ourselves to a few works representative of a growing trend within the church.

Acknowledgements and Dedication
Receiving the Word is a distillation of my views on the crucial issue of biblical authority
and interpretation, developed through interaction with others. I claim neither originality nor
infallibility for it. It is simply an honest attempt by an inquiring Bible student to make sense of
these issues amid the confusing voices being echoed by some of our brightest and most articulate.
While taking full responsibility for the contents in this volume, I want to express my
profound gratitude to the following individuals who in various ways have influenced my thought
and temperament on fundamental issues of theology.
· To all the scholars whose views have come under review in this work. But for their
critical questions, I would have taken for granted the serious efforts by our Adventist forebears in
grounding our doctrines on a solid theological foundation--the Bible.
· To my teachers--especially Daniel Augsburger, Fernando Canale, Arthur Coetzee,
Richard Davidson, Raoul Dederen, Hans LaRondelle, and William Shea. They modelled for me
what is expected of a Seventh-day Adventist student of the Bible.
· To my colleagues--Leslie Pollard, Ganoune Diop, Ron du Preez, Victor Dyman, Martin
Hannah, Frank Hasel, Roland Hill, Trust Ndlovu, Elwin St. Rose, Carlos Steger, Winfried Vogel,
Nathaniel Walemba, and Oswald Williams (deceased). Their indomitable spirit in past debates
taught me what is required in the battle of ideas.
· To my partners in evangelism--Paul Yeboah, Emmanuel Osei, and other leaders and
members of the Ghanaian churches in North America and Europe. They have confirmed my
belief that true Adventist theology, when proclaimed with conviction, results in revival and
conversion.
· To the scores of readers of the different drafts of the book manuscript--men and women,
leaders and lay members, teachers and students--for their input and helpful critiques. Special
appreciation goes to those who have publicly endorsed the book; though the views of each may
be expected to vary on a few specifics, they have all found this work worthy of their
commendation.
· To the publishers and distributors of ADVENTISTS AFFIRM, whose unwavering support
for works that reflect the Bible-based position of traditional Seventh-day Adventism has
encouraged the publication of this present volume. Their conscientious and careful editorial help
has reaffirmed to me the solemn truth that, even in our age of theological pluralism, God still
expects Seventh-day Adventist writers, editors, and publishers to give Him their very best,
publishing only works that are Bible-centered in content and edifying in effect.
· To the students, faculty, staff, and all participants in our Summer 1996
evangelistic/revival meetings on the campus of the Adventist Seminary of West Africa (ASWA),
Nigeria--for their spiritual support when I was tempted to delay the publication of this work.
During our meetings, they demonstrated tangibly that anyone who takes the Bible seriously as the
inspired Word of God finds true meaning in their favorite theme song: "Where could I go, O
where could I go; Seeking a refuge for my soul? Needing a friend to save me in the end; Where
could I go but to the Lord?"
Finally, a word of appreciation to my family--Becky, Jessica, Ellen, and Samuel, Jr., who
have demonstrated to me the meaning of the favorite Adventist phrase, "Here is the patiencef the
saints. . . ." Their spirit of sacrifice assures me that, indeed, "those who in everything make God
first and last and best are the happiest people in the world" (My Life Today, p. 161).
Dedication
15
Receiving the Word is dedicated to five Seventh-day Adventists who have played
significant roles in upholding God's Word, even against tremendous odds. Of these, three are
resting in the hope of the resurrection, while two are still laboring for the Lord.
The late Elder Enoch de Oliveira of Brazil last served the church as a General Conference
vice-president; he represents the courageous church administrators who are faithfully guarding
the Word, no matter the political cost.
The late Dr. Gerhard F. Hasel of Germany was the dean of the Seventh-day Adventist
Theological Seminary at Andrews University and the director of its Ph.D. program; he represents
the faithful scholars of the church who contribute greatly to scholarship without surrendering the
Word.
Elder Paul K. Nsiah of Ghana, West Africa, is a dedicated church member who has been
instrumental in the growth and leadership of the church in that part of the world; he represents the
gallant laymen around the world who are fearlessly holding church leaders and scholars
accountable to the Word.
The late Larissa Petrovna of Ukraine was one of the faithful believers who kept the faith
alive during the difficult days of Soviet communism by preserving, secretly copying, and
distributing copies of the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy; she represents our God-fearing and
devoted lay women worldwide who would rather die than dishonor the Lord and His Word.
Elder Charles D. Brooks of the United States, a dedicated pastor and evangelist, is a field
secretary of the General Conference. At a time when it has become fashionable for preachers to
turn to secular psychology, entertainment, politics, rhetoric, and all the latest fads of
contemporary culture, he has set an example for Christians around the world by courageously
preaching the Word.

Chapter 1
Crisis Over the Word
These are exciting days for Seventh-day Adventists. Inspiring mission reports at the
General Conference session. Progress in God's work worldwide. Growth of the church, even in
the industrialized areas of Australia, Europe and North America. Gathering of God's people from
"every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people." Thousands everyday heeding the voice from
heaven saying, "Come out of Babylon, my people."
These are, indeed, thrilling days for Adventists around the world.
But alongside revival and rapid growth come disturbing indications that many
Seventh-day Adventists, at least in the industrialized world, are facing an identity crisis.1 The
church's most distinctive theological doctrines are being challenged--from within. Uncertainty
prevails over the church's unique identity and mission, and its worldwide organizational unity is
being defied. This is the crisis facing the church today. But why?
The "Liberal Left" and The "Independent Right"
The Seventh-day Adventist church is caught in the middle of a crossfire of attacks from
the "liberal left" and the "independent right." The liberals, often educated and influential, operate
within the church structure; the independents, appearing spiritual and orthodox, operate from
without by establishing organizations and structures of their own.
Both groups are critical of the church because they believe that today's Adventism is not
what it should be. So both attempt to "rehabilitate" the church.
In order to make Adventism "relevant" for this generation, the liberals seek to "liberate"
the church from its alleged "fundamentalist" doctrines and nineteenth-century Victorian lifestyle.
In their attempt to bring a "revival" to the church, the independents desire to "reform" the church
from its ways of "apostasy." The liberals reinterpret Adventism's historic doctrines; the
independents oppose any tampering with the Adventist pillars.
Regarding lifestyle or conduct, the liberals emphasize "love," "acceptance," and
"inclusiveness." The independents stress "law," "perfectionism," and "uniqueness."
When the liberals on the left speak about the Adventist church, they often seem to see
only the independents on the right; and when the independents discuss the church, one could
almost believe that all members of the church are liberals.
The independent right is often perceived as siphoning off tithe from the church; the liberal
left, which includes many church workers, is paid with tithe money while it often appears to be
challenging, if not undermining, the beliefs and practices of the church.
The activities of both groups are often encouraged by the silence and indifference of
mainstream Adventism.
Although in recent times an effort has been made to inform church members (not always
accurately) about the activities of the independent right,2 little has been done to alert unwary
Adventists to the influence of the entrenched liberal left. Ellen G. White stated that "we have far
more to fear from within than from without" (Selected Messages, 1:122). If this applies to our
current situation, then the mainstream Seventh-day Adventist church, caught in the crossfire,
should be more concerned about the liberals within than about the independents without.
The "crisis over the Word" is really a clash between two versions of Adventism that
currently operate within the church: mainstream Adventism and liberal Adventism.
This book, Receiving the Word, is a response to liberal Adventism's challenge to the
17
mainstream Adventist faith and lifestyle. It is this challenge, and the sophisticated manner in
which it is articulated by some leading thought leaders, that is creating an identity crisis in the
church.
A Crisis of Identity
Recently an Adventist professor of religion captured well the identity crisis plaguing the
church. She began with this thought-provoking question: "How seriously should Adventists take
apocalyptic books like Daniel, Revelation, and The Great Controversy?" Echoing the concerns of
some church scholars and members that apocalypticists (i.e., those holding to unique doctrines
about end-time events) "are embarrassing to have around," she continued, "We may even wish to
revise our apocalyptic stance. Aren't we triumphalistic in seeing ourselves as the one true church?
Hasn't the Sabbath/Sunday issue, so relevant when The Great Controversy was written, become
obsolete in today's secular society? Haven't Adventists erred in focusing on the pope while
neglecting to take a stand against oppressive dictators of the 20th century? Shouldn't we
concentrate on the modern 'beasts' of ethnic hatred, oppression of minorities, and abuse of the
ecosystem? Perhaps apocalyptic, with its sensationalism, represents an immature stage of
Christianity. Perhaps we should replace it with the gospel of love, acceptance, and forgiveness."3
No evidence in the article suggests that its author shares the views of those raising these
questions. But as we shall demonstrate in a later chapter, there are troubling signs that some
within our membership do want us to reinterpret our distinctive doctrines to accommodate
contemporary secular thought.
For example, in a book endorsed by several thought leaders of the church, a chaplain and
teacher in an Adventist university urges the church to consider seriously the need to embrace the
"new ecumenism" of the charismatic movement. In his opinion, Adventist "remnant" theology,
which is "more firmly ingrained in the Adventist psyche because of Ellen White's powerful
endorsement," leads to "ethnocentrism," "xenophobia," and "paranoia."4
On the basis of naturalistic interpretations of scientific data, a retired General Conference
vice-president and educator recently announced his belief that animals lived and died for millions
of years before human beings came into existence. He asserted that his new belief "is a big step
for a Seventh-day Adventist when you are taught that every form of life came into existence in
six days."5
Various Adventist authors are challenging the necessity of Christ's substitutionary death
for sinners, the relevance of the sanctuary doctrine, the Spirit of Prophecy, and the belief in the
nearness of Christ's second coming. Still others are embracing homosexuality, the moderate use
of alcohol, the eating of unclean foods, and the wearing of jewelry as acceptable lifestyle
elements for Adventists.6 These authors and scholars suggest that the historic beliefs and
practices of the Seventh-day Adventist church, indeed, its self-understanding as God's end-time
remnant, represent "an immature stage of Christianity."
What has led to these conclusions?
Crisis Over the Word
It is far too simple to claim, as some do, that our varying positions on abortion, women's
ordination, homosexuality, polygamy, divorce, war, and racism have arisen merely because of
our different cultural or educational backgrounds.7 Rather, the fundamental issue concerns the
way we interpret the Bible.
The crisis facing contemporary Adventism is not necessarily due to a clash of two
cultures--"the church of the West" and "the rest of the church." Rather, it is a crisis over biblical
18
hermeneutics, the appropriate principles for interpreting the Bible. Recently this crisis has
spawned much new hermeneutical terminology in our church: casebook vs. codebook, principle
vs. literal approach, contextual vs. key text approach, dynamic vs. rigid approach, principle/spirit
vs. literal/letter, historical-critical method vs. historical-grammatical method, and perhaps other
terms as well.
In addressing the issue of Bible interpretation (hermeneutics), Seventh-day Adventists are
faced with only two options: (1) the historic Adventist approach to Scripture, which recognizes
that the Bible is fully inspired, trustworthy, and authoritative, and (2) the contemporary liberal
approaches to the Bible, which deny the full inspiration, reliability and authority of Scriptures.
Although these two approaches are miles apart, they are both agreed in their rejection of a
third approach--namely, the "proof-text" method of interpretation. It may be helpful to explain
why.
Proof-Text Method of Interpretation
Simply put, a proof-text is a verse or a longer passage used to establish a point. If the
passage in its context supports the point, such use is legitimate.
When we refer to a proof-text method, however, we mean using an isolated text
arbitrarily to prove one's own point. Such a proof-text approach emphasizes the practical,
devotional application of Scripture to the interpreter's needs. The student goes to the Bible to
search for some texts to support or prove positions on which he has already made up his mind.
This method is inadequate because it fails to take into account the historical and literary context
of each passage of Scripture.
Some Examples. The proof-text method takes passages out of context in order to feed
them into the world of one's personal preoccupations. One writer cites the example of a seminary
student who, after accepting a call to start his ministry in the North of England, later received a
more attractive offer to teach in South Wales. Earnestly seeking ways to withdraw from his
previous commitment, he read the words of Isaiah 43:6, "I will say to the north, Give up," and
concluded that God was providentially telling him to "give up" his commitment to serve in the
North of England! Of course, if he had read the next line of that verse, he would have heard the
continuation of God's "providential message." It reads: ". . . and to the south, Keep not back"!
This illustrates the old maxim that "a text without its context becomes a pretext." The
proof-text method of Bible interpretation fails to consider seriously the historical context of a
given passage. Instead of reading the entire passage in which the texts were found, the interpreter
simply chooses several key phrases that coincide with his concerns.
Second, it ignores the literary context in which a given text is found by taking the Bible in
a "literalistic" manner. Whereas a sound method of interpretation will recognize the different
kinds of literature and idioms in the Bible, a proof-text method reads the Bible naively. For
example, it fails to realize that since the story about the rich man and Lazarus is a parable, it
cannot be taken as an event that actually happened. The proof-text method also fails to recognize
that the Bible exhibits other literary features, such as poetry (e.g., Psalms, Proverbs, etc.),
symbolisms (as found in apocalyptic books, e.g., Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Revelation), and
idioms, that require careful interpretation.
Third, the proof-text method approaches biblical interpretation superficially. Instead of
engaging in a responsible and painstaking study of Scriptures, those adopting this method take
the easy route, sneaking foreign meanings into a text to obtain a desired response. Often, those
resorting to this method are content with studying the Bible only in a particular translation (e.g.,
the King James Version, Revised Standard Version, New International Version, etc.), with little
desire to consult either the original languages in which the Bible was written, or other
19
translations, or even the understanding of the text gained by other godly Christians who also have
wrestled with the same kinds of issues.
The proof-text approach to Scripture can lead to misguided conclusions. You probably
have heard the story of the man who adopted such an approach to seek the will of God in a major
decision of his life. Unwilling to engage in the painstaking effort of studying the Bible in its
historical and grammatical context as the basis for drawing valid applications for his situation, he
decided to close his eyes, open his Bible at random, prayerfully put his finger down, and get
guidance from whatever verse his finger landed on. His first try came up with "Judas went out
and hanged himself" (Matt 27:5). Finding these words unhelpful, he tried again and this time got
"Go, and do thou likewise" (Luke 10:37). In desperation he tried one more time. The text he
found was: "That thou doest, do quickly" (John 13:27).
This story may not be true, but it aptly illustrates the dangers inherent in the proof-text
method. Though this approach takes the Bible as God's inspired, trustworthy and authoritative
message for all people--a foundational assumption which every Bible-believing Christian must
share--yet the proof-text method fails to "rightly divide the word of truth" (2 Tim 2:15). It looks
for meaning in Scripture not by probing the historical-grammatical context, but by discarding it.
Correct biblical hermeneutics seeks to discover the original meaning of Scripture in its
proper context and to draw out principles for contemporary application. We must always read
what is there in the text, not read into the text our own presuppositions. Bringing out from the text
what is already there is called exposition; the technical name is exegesis. Reading into the text
one's opinions, ideas, or assumptions is known as imposition; the technical term is eisegesis.
Not a Legitimate Approach. Because of the proof-text method's inadequacies, n serious
Seventh-day Adventist Bible student accepts this method as legitimate. This is why, in the
present crisis over the Word in the church, proponents of the two competing methods have rightly
rejected the proof-text method of biblical interpretation.
These two methods to which we shall now direct our attention--mainstream Adventism's
plain reading of Scripture and contemporary liberalism's historical-critical method--seek an
understanding of Scripture that takes into account the historical and literary contexts of the Bible.
But as we pointed out earlier, these two approaches differ in their views regarding the full
inspiration, trustworthiness, and authority of the Bible.
The Cause of the Hermeneutical Crisis
To understand the cause of the hermeneutical crisis--the crisis over the principles and
methods of Bible interpretation--it may be helpful to present a potential problem from Scripture
and show how adherents of the two conflicting approaches (the mainstream Adventist approach
and liberalism's historical-critical method) are likely to respond.
The Quail Problem. Most Christians tend to skip over the details of the "quail story" in
the Bible, but those details can present a challenge to serious Bible students. Numbers 11 records
how, in response to the cries of the wandering Israelites for meat, God provided so many quails to
be eaten that in one month the meat would virtually come out of their nostrils and become
"loathsome" to them. The quails are reported as covering territory extending a day's journey on
each side of the camp--an area some forty miles across, and two cubits (about three feet) high
above the ground (Num 11:4-23, 31-35).
Are the details in this quail story trustworthy? Or is the Bible simply teaching that God
miraculously sustained Israel in the wilderness? Should we consider all the information recorded
in the account as inspired, or are some things in the account not inspired?
Similar questions also confront Christians on other matters, such as the issue of the
20
Genesis creation account. When the Bible says God created the world in six literal days, is the
statement trustworthy? Or do the Scriptures simply seek to teach us Who is the ultimate Creator,
not necessarily how He created and how long it took? Shall we accept the principle that God is
the Creator but discard the literal six-day creation as uninspired, culturally conditioned, an
un-scientific myth, or even a minor error?
Compounding the Issue. Regarding the quail, critics of the Bible often raise "troubling"
issues regarding the sheer number of birds involved (Num 11:31). Assuming that one's
understanding of the Bible is correct in maintaining that God caused the birds to be piled up three
feet deep over an area of 1600 square miles (40 miles x 40 miles), Bible-believers are faced with
two major problems.
First, since some of the birds would die from the sheer pressure of those lying on top of
them, how could Israel cope with the resulting health hazards and environmental problems?
Second, and more significant, is the problem of the number of quails for each Israelite to
consume during the thirty days. Assuming that the birds were distributed equally to each Israelite,
each person would have had to eat about 52,100 bushels during the month. This works out to
approximately 578 bushels of quails per person per meal, three times a day for each of the thirty
days! This is equivalent to eating some 742 roasted turkeys at each meal!8
Clarifying the Issues. Assuming that we have not misread the biblical account and that
our calculations are correct, are we really to believe that each Israelite ate 578 bushels of quail
meat at each meal? If not, does it mean that while we may accept the fact that God provided
quails for the wandering pilgrims, we cannot trust the reliability of the data? The Bible says,
"And there went forth a wind from the Lord and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by
the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side,
round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth" (Num 11:31).
Should we accept the fact of God's providence of quail but not the associated details? Is
the Bible fully inspired or partially inspired--that is, did God inspire the Bible writers to record
these details, even though they appear to us unrealistic?
The answers one gives to such questions determine whether one will uphold the
long-standing Adventist approach to Scripture or the contemporary liberal approaches,
collectively known as the historical-critical method. These two approaches to Scripture have
become the focal point of Adventism's crisis over biblical authority and interpretation. Responses
to the quail story, to which we will return, illustrate the two major attitudes regarding biblical
authority and interpretation.
The Historic Adventist Approach: Plain Reading of Scripture
The mainstream Seventh-day Adventist church consists of millions of people around the
world who have accepted Jesus as their Savior and Lord, the Bible as His inspired and
solely-authoritative Word, the church as God's end-time remnant movement, and the writings of
Ellen G. White as a manifestation of the true gift of prophecy. As a summary of their doctrinal
beliefs, they uphold the "Fundamental Beliefs" of Seventh-day Adventists, which have been
expounded in the book Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . .: A Biblical Exposition of 27
Fundamental Beliefs.9
Method: Plain Reading. Seventh-day Adventists have always adopted the approach
advanced by the Protestant reformers, in which they sought the simple, plain, direct, or ordinary
sense of Scripture. Technically, this method of studying Scriptures is known as the
21
historical-grammatical method, a term dating to 1788.10
Until the eighteenth century Enlightenment, when higher criticism of the Bible led some
skeptics to question the full inspiration and trustworthiness of Scriptures, the overwhelming
majority of Bible-believing Christians followed this "plain sense" method of interpreting the
Bible. The name "historical-grammatical method" describes the approach that focuses attention
on a detailed analysis of the biblical text in accordance with the original language and historical
situation.
Though the term may seem new to some readers, it represents the Adventist church's
historic practice of interpreting Scripture according to its simple, literal, plain, direct, or ordinary
sense. The specific details of this historical-grammatical method are spelled out in a 1986
General Conference Annual Council document called "Methods of Bible Study," published in the
Adventist Review of January 22, 1987, and reprinted here in Appendix C. Opposite to
"historical-grammatical" is "historical-critical," a relatively new term for what was long known as
"higher criticism."
Assumptions About the Bible. Adventism's plain reading of Scripture (the
historical-grammatical approach) recognizes that the Bible is (a) fully inspired, (b) absolutely
trustworthy, (c) solely authoritative, and (d) thoroughly consistent in all its parts, since it comes
ultimately from one divine mind.
Goal in Interpretation. Relying upon the Holy Spirit's illumination, believers using this
method seek to ascertain the meaning of Scripture by carefully discovering the historical, literary
and grammatical identity of a given biblical passage in its immediate historical context and in the
wider context of the whole Bible. Having thus understood what a given passage meant in its
historical context, the interpreter makes a responsible application to the contemporary situation.
This method should not be confused with a "literalistic" approach which does not take into
consideration the historical, grammatical, and literary (e.g., poetry, parable, symbol, epistle, etc.)
characteristics found in the Bible.
Adventists and Quails. Regarding the "quail problem," those who adopt the historic
Adventist approach insist that the Bible is fully inspired and trustworthy even in the details about
the quails. Therefore, in the face of an unresolved difficulty, rather than maintaining that the
Bible writer was mistaken in his figures, we carefully re-study the biblical account to see if we
have not erred in our interpretation. We shall explore the quail problem more fully shortly, to
show in detail how a Bible-believing student may approach it.
The Contemporary Liberal Approach:
The Historical-Critical Method
Alongside historic Adventism's plain reading of Scripture are also the methods of
theological liberalism, collectively known as the historical-critical method. At the time the
Seventh-day Adventist church emerged in the nineteenth century, this approach to Scripture was
already in full bloom, going by the name "higher criticism." One Adventist scholar correctly
observed, "Known as 'higher criticism,' right up to the early 1970s the historical-critical method
was perceived as highly suspect by almost all Adventists who were aware of it."11 We shall use
the terms interchangeably throughout this book.
Two Kinds of Liberalism. Since higher criticism is the method of liberalism, it may be
helpful to note that two kinds of liberalism operate in Christian churches: (1) classical (radical)
22
liberalism and (2) moderate (progressive) liberalism.
Classical liberalism denies God's supernatural intervention in the world; hence, it denies
the virgin birth, the bodily resurrection, the penal substitutionary atonement of Christ, miracles,
etc. Because of classical liberalism's anti-supernatural assumptions, it cannot accept the Bible's
claim to be divinely inspired by God. The Bible is "inspired" in the sense that Shakespeare is
inspired; it is an inspiring book that reflects the religious expressions of certain ancient people.
All the miracles in the Bible are myths designed to teach truths. Because of this naturalistic
outlook, liberal scholars in conservative churches cannot be liberals in the classical or radical
sense; they choose moderate liberalism.
Unlike classical liberalism, moderate liberalism attracts some scholars in Bible-believing
conservative churches, who present themselves as "moderates" because they perceive themselves
as standing between the "extremism of the left" (classical liberalism) and "the extremism of the
right" (which they label as "fundamentalism" or "ultra conservativism"). Although moderate
liberals reject classical liberalism's outright denial of supernatural events in the Bible, they
nevertheless endorse liberalism's skepticism regarding the full inspiration, trustworthiness, and
authority of the Bible. In their attitude toward the Bible, the liberalisms of both the moderate and
classical stripe are basically the same; they differ only in degree. Because moderate liberalism
does not accept the full authority, authenticity, historicity, and reliability of the Bible, its
followers rely on the methods of classical liberalism to determine which parts of the Bible are
inspired and trustworthy.
Liberalism's Method. Both forms of liberalism deny the full inspiration of the Bible,
choosing to approach Scripture "like any other book." In doing so, liberalism offers a number of
"scientific" methods collectively called the historical-critical method.12 Although the roots of
contemporary higher criticism go back as far as the seventeenth century, the nineteenth-century
German theologian and historian Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923) holds the distinction of formulating
the cardinal principles of the historical-critical method.13
The historical-critical method consists of such diverse and often conflicting approaches as
"historical criticism," "literary-source criticism," "form criticism," "redaction criticism,"
"comparative-religion criticism," "structural criticism," etc.14 By employing these approaches,
liberalism seeks to elucidate the true meaning of the Bible.
Both classical and moderate liberalism employ today's higher criticism; they differ only in
how far they go in denying explicit biblical teaching. Moderate liberalism, the kind found in
conservative Bible-believing churches, believes that it can employ the methods of classical
liberalism without accepting its anti-supernatural presuppositions. But moderate liberalism and
classical liberalism are basically the same in their methods of approaching Scripture.
Assumptions. Unlike the traditional Adventist approach, the higher-critical methods
assume that: (a) the Bible is not fully inspired (i.e., some parts of the Bible are more inspired than
others15); (b) the Bible is not fully trustworthy (because of alleged discrepancies, contradictions,
and mistakes); (c) the Bible is not absolutely authoritative in all that it teaches or touches upon
(portions allegedly shaped by the personal or cultural prejudices of the writers and their times are
"uninspired" and not binding on us); and (d) because of the Bible's many human writers, there is
"diversity" in Scripture (i.e., pluralism or conflicting theologies in the Bible).
Goal of Interpretation. Relying upon "reason dialoging with Spirit" or "sanctified
imagination," proponents of contemporary higher criticism seek to reconstruct the meaning of
Scripture by recreating the real-life situations, the various socio-cultural elements that allegedly
shaped the biblical text in a long evolutionary development from its earliest stages to its present
form. In some cases, they may attempt to draw applications ("positive principles") for our time.
23
Liberals and Quail. The two kinds of liberals are likely to respond in slightly different
ways to the quail story.
On the one hand, classical (or radical) liberalism, denying any possibility of miracle,
rejects as a myth the account of God's provision of quails. At best, it will reinterpret the miracle
and reconstruct the biblical account along this line: "A group of nomadic tribes of pre-historic
Israel (numbering far less than the 600,000 figure given in the Bible), while wandering in the
wilderness, came across a few migrating birds which had paused to rest for the night. Seeing this
phenomenon for possibly the first time, the Israelites attributed it to their God and exaggerated
the number of birds 'rained down' to highlight their God's omnipotence."
On the other hand, moderate liberals accept the miracle of God in providing quails. But
because of such problems as the 578 bushels per meal per person and the environmental hazard,
they may discount the accuracy of the story. They are likely to argue that Christians should not be
concerned about how God provided the quails. The important point in the story, they would say,
is that God did provide food for His people, a truth that is valid even though the details about it
may not be trustworthy. The underlying assumption is that some parts of the Bible are inspired
while others are not.
Although moderate liberals differ from classical liberals in their attitudes toward miracles,
they both share a skeptical attitude toward the full inspiration and trustworthiness of Scripture. In
order to arrive at a more "realistic," "objective" or "scientific" understanding of the quail story,
they both employ liberalism's historical-critical method.
This manner of addressing the "difficulty" in the quail story finds expression also in other
issues, such as the Genesis creation account, the universality of Noah's flood, the account of the
Exodus, the question of God's showing a real sanctuary to Moses as the model upon which he
was to construct Israel's tabernacle, the veracity of the four gospel writers in reporting the same
events, etc. In short, a misunderstanding about the nature of the Bible's inspiration,
trustworthiness, authority, and interpretation influences one's views about other doctrines of the
Bible.
Historic Adventism and Contemporary Liberalism
Various expressions in use today disguise the conflict between liberal and historic
Adventist approaches to Bible interpretation. These expressions, as we noted earlier, include:
casebook vs. codebook approach; principle vs. literal approach; contextual vs. key text approach;
dynamic vs. rigid approach; principle/spirit vs. literal/letter approach; Christ-centered vs.
fundamentalist approach; and many more. But inasmuch as the hermeneutical crisis facing the
church threatens to undermine our basic doctrines and lifestyle, Adventists must understand the
real issues.
Similarities and Differences. Both the historic Adventist approach and the contemporary
liberal approaches seek to understand, through a careful study of the historical setting, literary
characteristics, grammar, syntax, etc., what Scripture meant to its original recipients. Both also
apply Scripture's message to contemporary situations. They differ not only in how they
accomplish their common goal of elucidating the meaning of Scripture, but more importantly, in
their assumptions or presuppositions regarding the nature of Scripture itself.
One knowledgeable Adventist scholar has summarized the difference between these two
approaches: "The historical-critical scholar comes to the [biblical] text with a natural bias against
the historicity of the events described therein. The historico[-]grammatical scholar comes to the
text with a natural bias in favor of the historicity of the events described therein. How, then, shall
24
the matter be settled? There should be a neutral ground upon which the matters involved could be
examined dispassionately and objectively. Unfortunately, there is not."16
Yet, in spite of the fact that even some reputable non-Adventist scholars have found the
use of today's higher-critical methodologies to be "an illusion,"17 "secular and profane,"18 and
even "bankrupt,"19 some Adventist Bible scholars believe they can reasonably use a little of the
historical-critical method without adopting the naturalistic presuppositions on which the method
is founded20--a claim to which Eta Linnemann responded bluntly: "One can no more be a little
historical-critical than a little pregnant."21 Linnemann, by the way, is unquestionably a
world-class expert in, and a former advocate of, the historical-critical method.22
Quail Revisited. We promised to return to the quail story and look at it using the historic
Adventist approach, the perspective of faith rather than of doubt. This approach rejects
liberalism's skepticism regarding the full inspiration and trustworthiness of the Bible account.
Heeding Mrs. White's counsel and example, its practitioners "take the Bible just as it is, as the
Inspired Word," and they "believe its utterances in an entire Bible" (Selected Messages, 1:17). If
they find difficulties they cannot immediately resolve, rather than considering them as mistakes
or exaggerations by the Bible writers, they prayerfully seek guidance from the Holy Spirit to open
their minds to see the divine truthfulness of the Scriptures.
Regarding the quail, the Bible simply states: "And there went forth a wind from the Lord,
and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this
side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two
cubits high upon the face of the earth" (Num 11:31). Notice that the Bible doesn't say that the
quails were packed solid, or piled up two cubits (three feet) deep, from ground up, over a territory
forty miles across. Rather, Scripture says that the birds were brought "two cubits high upon the
face of the earth." The New International Version translates it, "Now a wind . . . brought them
down all around the camp to about three feet above the ground, as far as a day's walk in any
direction." The Bible is merely saying that instead of the birds flying so high that they were out of
reach, God brought them so low--about three feet above ground level--that anyone could take as
many as he wanted (note Num 11:32).
All the mathematical calculations showing that each Israelite had to eat some 578 bushels
of quail meat per meal and all the worry about environmental hazards resulting from the
carcasses of tons of birds are misdirected. The "troubling problems" raised about the quail story
do not reside in the text but in the minds of critics who read the Bible superficially. Ellen White
may have been referring to such situations when she wrote about the dangers of presenting the
works of infidel authors to students of the Bible: "Scientific research becomes misleading,
because its discoveries are misinterpreted and perverted. The word of God is compared with the
supposed teachings of science, and is made to appear uncertain and untrustworthy. Thus the seeds
of doubt are planted in the minds of the youth, and in time of temptation they spring up. When
faith in God's word is lost, the soul has no guide, no safeguard. The youth are drawn into paths
which lead away from God and from everlasting life" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 41).
The simple resolution of the quail problem should encourage us always to trust the Word
as God's inspired revelation, even if we face apparent difficulties. "The Bible is a book which has
been refuted, demolished, overthrown, and exploded more times than any other book you ever
heard of. Every little while somebody starts up and upsets this book; and it is like upsetting a
solid cube of granite. It is just as big one way as the other; and when you have upset it, it is right
side up, and when you overturn it again, it is right side up still. Every little while somebody blows
up the Bible; but when it comes down, it always lights upon its feet, and runs faster than ever
through the world."23
25
Moderate Liberalism: A Challenge to Adventism
The greatest challenge facing the Seventh-day Adventist church does not come from the
independent right who operate from without, but rather from the liberal left who are working
from within. These moderate liberals seek to redefine historic Adventist beliefs according to their
new views of the Bible.
The Church's Challenge. We must b clear about it. The crisis of identity in the
Seventh-day Adventist church is a crisis over Bible interpretation. It arises from the fact that
some in our ranks believe they can safely use elements of the historical-critical method without
adopting the naturalistic presuppositions upon which the method was founded. However, in the
words of one non-Adventist scholar, the attempt to do so is "as futile and absurd an undertaking
as eating ham with Jewish presuppositions."24
Indeed, as some of our Adventist scholars have begun using the higher critical approaches
of liberal theology, the church has seen challenges to its distinctive truths: the prophetic
significance of 1844, the necessity and relevance of the sanctuary doctrine, the inspiration of
Ellen G. White, a literal six-day creation, the necessity of Christ's substitutionary atonement for
sinners, and the self-understanding of the Seventh-day Adventist church as God's end-time
remnant. At the same time, the church has been thrown into turmoil over abortion, polygamy,
divorce and remarriage, women's ordination, and homosexuality.
In the coming days, the Seventh-day Adventist church will be focusing on the issues of
biblical authority and interpretation. Reading the Bible through one or the other of the two basic
hermeneutical lenses--Adventism's plain reading of Scripture or the higher criticism of
contemporary liberalism--will result in either a clear perception or in a blind deception regarding
the Bible's message. Bible-believing Adventists must look beyond the fancy labels and claims,
inquiring to what extent these new approaches uphold the Bible as fully inspired, trustworthy and
the sole authoritative norm for every doctrine and practice. Such a test will uncover the
foundations and ultimate destinations of the new methods of biblical interpretation. It will also
reveal whether the new approaches will result in either trusting the Word or in doubting the
Word. Subsequent pages in this book will explore this issue in greater depth.
NOTES
1. The president of the General Conference stated this concern recently: "In many of
the more developed and sophisticated areas of the world, I sense that an increasingly secular
value system is negatively impacting many of our members. I sense a growing uncertainty about
why we exist as a church and what our mission is." See Robert S. Folkenberg, "When Culture
Doesn't Count," Ministry, December 1995, p. 7, emphasis supplied.

independent right, readers should understand that there are many legitimate independent
ministries whose goals and methods complement the work of the mainstream church.

6. In chapter 5 of this book we shall document some of the sophisticated ways in
which the historic Adventist doctrines and practices are being undermined.
7. For example, see Jack W. Provonsha's analysis of the "Roots of the Crisis" of
identity regarding Adventists' understanding of the remnant. Provonsha, A Remnant in Crisis
(Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald, 1993), pp. 27-35.
8. The calculation was worked out in this manner: (a) A day's journey is about 20
miles; since the quails fell by the camp "as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a
day's journey on the other side, round about the camp," it suggests that the quails covered a
distance of 20 miles on each side of the camp, totaling 40 miles from north to south, and 40 miles
from east to east; (b) An estimate of the total amount of quail rained down 3 feet deep and 40
miles across and 40 miles in width gives 133,816 million cubic feet (i.e. 40 miles [211,200 feet] x
40 miles [211,200 feet] x 3 feet); (c) 1 cubic foot = 0.77873 bushels, so that there were over 100
billion bushels (104,206,482,800, i.e., 0.77873 x 133,816,320,000); (d) There were 600,000 men
(Num 11:21), so that allowing for children and women, there were about 2 million people. If we
divide 104,206,482,800 bushels of quail among 2 million people, each gets about 52,000 bushels
in the month. Now if each person eats three meals of quail a day, the average person will eat
some 578 bushels at each meal (i.e., if we divide 52,000 by 90 meals [3 meals/day x 30
days/month = 90]); (e) Since 1 bushel = 1.28 cubic feet, if we estimate that one roasted turkey can
be contained in a box measuring 1.28 ft. x 1.28 ft. x 1.28 ft., the 578 bushels of quail meat will be
equivalent to 742 roasted turkeys.

10. Evangelical scholar Walter C. Kaiser, drawing on the work of Milton S. Terry,
attributed the term "grammatico-historical" to Karl A. G. Keil's Latin treatise on historical
interpretation (1788) and his German textbook on New Testament hermeneutics (1810). The aim
of this method of exegesis is to determine the author's intended meaning by means of the
grammar of his language and by the historical and cultural circumstances. While the historical
component is self-explanatory, according to Kaiser "The term grammatico-, however, is
somewhat misleading since we usually mean by 'grammatical' the arrangement of words and
construction of sentences. But Keil had in mind the Greek word gramma, and his use of the term
grammatico approximates what we would understand by the term literal (to use a synonym
derived from the Latin). Thus, the grammatical sense, in Keil's understanding, is the simple,
direct, plain, ordinary and literal sense of the phrases, clauses and sentences" (Kaiser, Toward An
Exegetical Theology [Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 1981], pp. 87-88; cf. Terry Biblical
27
Hermeneutics: A Treatise on the Interpretation of the Old and New Testaments [New York:
Phillips & Hunt, 1890; reprint ed., Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1964], pp. 203-242).
Readers should also note that, at least in the nineteenth-century, some higher critics claimed that
they were actually using the historical-grammatical method. For a discussion of this, see P.
Gerard Damsteegt, Foundations of the Seventh-day Adventist Message and Missions (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1977), pp. 63-77, esp. p. 70.
11. Robert McIver, "The Historical-Critical Method: The Adventist Debate,"
Ministry, March 1996, p. 14.
12. The historical-critical method is described as "critical" because, instead of simply
receiving the Word as God's inspired and trustworthy communication of His will to all humanity,
this approach adopts an attitude of skepticism to the Bible, rejecting those parts of the Scriptures
that are incompatible with the tenets of Enlightenment rationalism. Thus, the historical-critical
method has correctly been defined as "that principle of historical reasoning . . . that reality is
uniform and universal, that it is accessible to human reason and investigation, that all events
historical and natural occurring within it are in principle comparable by analogy, and that man's
contemporary experience of reality can provide the objective criteria by which what could or
could not have happened in the past is to be determined" (R. N. Soulen, Handbook of Biblical
Criticism [Atlanta, Ga.: John Knox, 1976], p. 78).

to Scriptures, see Gerhard Maier, Biblical Hermeneutics (Wheaton, Ill.: Crossway, 1994), pp.
251-255; William Larkin, Culture and Biblical Hermeneutics (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker,

Bible as the Word of God (Washington, D.C.: Biblical Research Institute, 1985); Hasel,
Understanding the Living Word of God (Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press, 1980).
15. This is the moderate view; classical historical criticism would not speak of
"inspiration" in this sense at all, since such a concept is unscientific and beyond the assumptions
of history.
16. William H. Shea, "How Shall We Understand the Bible?" Ministry, March 1996,
p. 13. Shea correctly concluded that "the subject of hermeneutics eventually comes back to the
matter of presuppositions. . . . As far as the presupposition of the historico[-]grammatical method,
that presupposition is ultimately one of faith. I commend that presupposition to the readers of this
journal. When that presupposition is adopted, scholars are freed from their procrustean bed to
examine all of the evidence that comes to bear upon the interpretation of God's Word."

and recommended the method were abandoning it because of its failure to lead to a true
understanding of the Bible. For more on this, see the summary in William J. Larkin, Jr., Culture

[historical-critical] method (e.g., source criticism, redaction criticism, etc.) without adopting the
naturalistic presuppositions affirmed by the thorough-going practitioners of the method." See
Alden Thompson, "Are Adventists Afraid of Bible Study?" Spectrum 16/1 (April 1985):58, 56;

The latter work was established on the assumptions of the historical-critical method. A detailed
analysis and critique of Inspiration has come from the Adventist Theological Society; see Issues

forcefully that historical criticism is not a scientific methodology as it claims, but rather is a
pagan ideology.
22. Robert W. Yarbrough, the translator of Eta Linnemann's book from German into
English, writes: "Linnemann lodges a strong protest against the tendencies and methods of a
discipline she knows from the inside out. She is not taking potshots from afar; she was a diligent
and receptive student of some of this century's truly seminal thinkers in German New Testament
scholarship: Bultmann, Fuchs, Gogarten, and Ebeling. Later, inducted into the world's most
prestigious professional society for New Testament research, she was the peer of many others of
like stature" (Historical Criticism: Methodology or Ideology, p. 7). A later chapter of Receiving
the Word ("Testifying About the Word") presents Linnemann's own testimony about how she
came to give up the historical-critical method.

Chapter 2
Trusting the Word
Throughout the centuries, Bible-believing Christians have received the Scriptures as the
inspired, trustworthy, and authoritative Word of God. In this they have followed the example of
the Berean believers, whom Paul commended as "noble" because "they received the word with
all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily" (Acts 17:11). What makes the Bible
unique? And why have the followers of Christ always been found trusting the Word?
The Book of Books
The Christian church has always prized its Book as unique. The church family has
treasured this Book like an expensive jewel, even in the face of adversity and opposition from
unbelievers. This Book has separated Christians from non-Christians. It has divided the church
into orthodox and heretics, Protestants and Catholics, and in recent times conservatives and
liberals. What exactly is this Book called the Bible?
It refers to itself as "the Scriptures" (Matt 21:42; Luke 24:25-27, 44-45), "the book of the
Lord" (Isa 34:16), "the oracles of God" (Rom 3:2), "the good word of God" (Heb 6:5), and "the
Word of Christ" (Col 3:16).
Scripture also compares itself to a number of things to emphasize its important function.
As a lamp or light (Ps 119:105, 130; 2 Pet 1:19), it not only dispels the clouds of darkness in our
world and doubt in our lives but also helps us to escape dangers and see our way clearly in life.
As bread or food (Matt 4:4; Job 23:12), it feeds the hungry and provides nourishment for their
spiritual growth. As a mirror (James 1:23-25), it makes us see ourselves as we really are so that
we can be changed into the perfect mirror-image of Jesus Christ (2 Cor 3:18). As water (Ps
119:9; Eph 5:26; John 15:3), it has a cleansing and transforming power. As fire (Jer 20:9; 23:29;
Ps 39:3), it can melt all the alloys of sin in our lives. As a hammer (Jer 23:29), it can break
hardened hearts in ways that no human method can ever hope to do. As a sword (Eph 6:17; Heb
4:12), it can pierce the conscience, wound our pride and slay our rebellious spirit. As seed (Luke
8:11) it produces fruit in life. And as a "discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Heb
4:12), it teaches us not to criticize and judge the Bible, but rather to submit to its teachings.
Truly, this Book is like no other book.
A Unique Book
The Bible was written by some 40 different authors on three different continents (Africa,
Asia, and Europe), in countries hundreds of miles apart, over a period of about 1500 years. It
deals with matters of universal interest--history, philosophy, science, health, architecture,
religion, etc. It speaks to the needs of every generation, offers solutions to life's perplexities, and
even reveals the origin and future of our world. It has brought peace to troubled consciences,
comfort to the sorrowful, hope to the despairing, courage to the despondent, and the assurance of
reunion to the bereaved.
Originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, the Bible has been published in more
languages than any other book in history, and yet it has not lost its original emphasis. This unique
Book appeals to the young as well as the old, rich as well as poor, simple as well as wise. It
advocates the rights of every individual, including the poor and defenseless, and it demonstrates a
mysterious power to transform lives.
30
A careful reading of this unique Book reveals that: "The Bible was written by men upon
every level of political and social life, from the king upon his throne down to the herdsmen,
shepherds, fishermen, and petty politicians. Here are words written by princes, by poets, by
philosophers, by fishermen, by statesmen, by prophets, by priests, by publicans, by physicians, by
men learned in the wisdom of Egypt, by men educated in the school of Babylon, by men trained
at the feet of rabbis like Gamaliel. Men of every grade and class are represented in this
miraculous Volume. The circumstances under which the Book was written were sometimes most
difficult and always most varying. Parts of it were written in tents, deserts, cities, palaces, and
dungeons. Some of it was written in times of imminent danger and other parts in times of ecstatic
joy."1
But the remarkable thing about the Bible is that, despite the circumstances that gave birth
to the 66 different books of this Book, the contents of the Bible show a unique harmony. "It
contains all kinds of writing; but what a jumble it would be if sixty-six books were written in this
way by ordinary men. Suppose, for instance, that we get sixty-six medical books written by thirty
or forty different doctors of various schools, . . . bind them all together, and then undertake to
doctor a man according to that book! . . . Or suppose you get thirty-five ministers writing books
on theology, and then see if you can find any leather strong enough to hold the books together."2
A Unique Preservation
But there is more; the Bible has been preserved remarkably during the process of
transmission. Despite the fact that it was written on perishable material and was copied and
recopied for hundreds of years before the invention of the printing press or computers, the Bible,
when compared to all other ancient manuscripts, has displayed an unusual correctness in
transmission. Though we will say more in Chapter Eight, a brief explanation here will illustrate
this remarkable preservation.
With the exception of some sections of Ezra and half of Daniel that were written in
Aramaic, the Old Testament was written originally in Hebrew. The Hebrew alphabet had many
letters that looked very much alike. Observe, for example, the close resemblance between the
following letters:
Beth ( b ) and Kaph ( k )
Daleth ( d ) and Resh ( r )
Daleth ( d ) and final Kaph ( \ )
Vav ( w ) and Yodh ( y )
Vav ( w ) and final Nun ( } )
Heth ( x ) and He ( h )
Heth ( x ) and Tav ( t )
Pe ( p ) and Kaph ( k )
Further, if the left hand perpendicular line of He ( h ) is accidentally omitted or blurred by
a copyist, we have Daleth ( d ); so also, Tav ( t ) and Resh ( r ), and similarly Pe ( p ) and Kaph (
k ).
Up until about 700 A.D. when a group of Jewish scribes (called the Massoretes) invented
a system for writing the vowels, Hebrew writing consisted only of consonants with no
punctuation marks and, at times, barely any spaces between the words! It is a little like reading
Genesis 1:1-3 (KJV) as:
NTHBGNNNGGDCRTDTHHVNNDTHRTHNDTHRTHWSWTHT
31
FRMNDVDNDDRKNSSWSPNTHFCFTHDPNDTHSPRTFGDMV
DPNTHFCFTHWTRSNDGDSDLTTHRBLGHTNDTHRWSLGHT
The remarkable accuracy with which the Massoretes wrote down the text of the Bible is
due to strict rules that they followed. For example, no word or letter could be written from
memory. The words or letters of each section were counted, and if these did not tally with the
newly made copies, the new copy was discarded altogether and the task begun again. Bernard
Ramm has described the process that led to this unique accuracy:
"In reference to the Old Testament we know that the Jews preserved it as no other
manuscript has ever been preserved. With their masora (parva, magna and finalis) [methods of
counting] they kept tabs on every letter, syllable, word and paragraph. They had special classes of
men within their culture whose sole duty was to preserve and transmit these documents with
practically perfect fidelity--scribes, lawyers, massoretes. Who ever counted the letters and
syllables and words of Plato or Aristotle? Cicero or Seneca?"3
On the other hand, the New Testament was written n Koiné Greek--the common language
of people in the apostolic times. Though there are no original copies of the earliest writings of the
apostles, later hand-written copies have survived. These are called manuscripts--from the Latin
words manu scriptum, meaning "written by hand"; the abbreviations generally used by scholars
for the manuscripts are "MS" for the singular, and "MSS" for the plural.
The New Testament materials are much more recent to us than the Old Testament. But
whereas well-trained Jewish copyists were extremely careful in copying every word of the Old
Testament documents, factors such as the great demand for copies of New Testament to instruct
new believers and the frequent interruptions in copying due to hostilities and persecutions led to
hasty and sometimes careless copies of the original New Testament manuscripts. Fortunately for
us, because so many New Testament manuscripts have been preserved, we can always
cross-check any section whenever there is any doubt.
Because the original text of the Bible has been uniquely preserved, Christians can be
absolutely certain of its essential accuracy. The late Sir Frederic Kenyon, one-time director of the
British Museum and an authority on Bible manuscripts, put it this way: "The Christian can take
the whole Bible in his hand and say without fear or hesitation that he holds in it the true Word of
God, handed down without essential loss from generation to generation throughout the
centuries."4
A Unique Survival
Still, of all the books ever produced, the Bible has suffered the most vicious attacks. Yet it
has survived the persecution of critics and enemies. As on an anvil, "The hammers of the infidels
have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still
endures. If the book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago.
Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die
and the book still lives."5
Bernard Ramm asked rhetorically whether, besides the Bible, there has ever been a book
on philosophy, religion, psychology, or any other subject that has been so "chopped, knifed,
sifted, scrutinized, and vilified . . . with such venom and skepticism? with such thoroughness and
erudition? upon every chapter, line and tenet?" Ramm concluded: "A thousand times over, the
death knell of the Bible has been sounded, the funeral procession formed, the inscription cut on
the tombstone, and the committal read. But somehow the corpse never stays put. . . . Considering
the thorough learning of the critics and the ferocity and precision of the attacks, we would expect
the Bible to have been permanently entombed in some Christian genizah.* But such is hardly the
32
case. The Bible is still loved by millions, read by millions and studied by millions."6
Jesus said it best almost 2,000 years ago: "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
words shall not pass away" (Matt 24:35). Concerning this statement, someone has written: "The
empire of Caesar is gone; the legions of Rome are mouldering in the dust; the avalanches
Napoleon hurled upon Europe have melted away; the pride of the Pharaohs is fallen; the
pyramids they raised to be their tombs are sinking every day in the desert sands; Tyre is a rock for
fishermen's nets; Sidon has scarcely a rock left behind; but the Word of God survives. All things
that threatened to extinguish it have aided it, and it proves every day how transient is the noblest
monument that man can build, how enduring the least word God has spoken. Tradition has dug a
grave for it; intolerance has lighted for it many a fagot; many a Judas has betrayed it with a kiss;
many a Peter has denied it with an oath; many a Demas has forsaken it; but the Word of God still
endures."7
How do we account for the remarkable unity, power, survival and universal appeal of this
ancient Book?
A Unique Claim: Revelation
Though produced by human writers, the Bible makes a bold claim to its divine origin.
The apostle Paul wrote: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God" (2 Tim 3:16). This text
raises three questions about the Bible: (a) How much of Scripture is inspired? (b) How is "all
Scripture" inspired? (c) When and in what manner was Scripture inspired?
1. How much of Scripture is inspired? The context of 2 Timothy 3:16 suggests that "all
Scripture" refers to the entire Old Testament, the books that made up the Bible in the days of
Jesus and the apostles. But according to other New Testament passages, "all Scripture" also
includes the New Testament writings. For example, the apostle Peter refers to the writings of Paul
on the same basis as "the other scriptures" (2 Pet 3:15, 16); and Paul in 1 Timothy 5:18 quotes the
record in Luke 10:7, "The laborer is worthy of his reward," and refers to the statement as
"scripture."
If "all Scripture"--consisting of both the Old and New Testaments--is inspired, this
implies, contrary to the claims of critics and liberals, that the sections of the Bible which talk
about miracles, history, geography, ethics, science, etc., are all inspired, just as the doctrinal
sections are.
2. How is "all Scripture" inspired? 2 Timothy 3:16 makes it clear that "all Scripture is
given by inspiration of God [Greek theopneustos, literally 'God-breathed'8]," that it to say, all the
books of the Bible have a divine origin. Not only is God the fundamental source of the Bible, but
Jesus Christ was also intimately connected with the production of the Scriptures. Peter wrote: "Of
which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace
that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that
should follow" (1 Pet 1:10, 11).
The apostle Peter later wrote that the Holy Spirit was also an active participant in
producing the Scriptures: "Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of
God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Pet 1:21).
Thus the testimony of Scripture is that the book we call the Bible has its source in all the
members of the Trinity--God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Just as all three
members of the Godhead cooperated in the creation of the world, so also do we find all three
working together in giving to the world a unique Book, the Bible.
33
The Scriptures rarely discussed the method of revelation from God to the Bible writers.
The inspired Word simply states: "In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by
the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a [His] Son" (Heb 1:1, 2). The "many
and various ways God spoke" include: visions and dreams (Isa 1:1; Eze 1:1; Dan 7:1), direct
appearances (theophanies) and messages from God (Ex 3:2-7; 20:1), through an angel (Dan
8:15-16; 9:21-22; Rev 1:1-4), eyewitness accounts (1 John 1:1-3; 2 Pet 1:16-18), reflection on
nature and human experience (Ps 8:3, 4; Rom 2:14-15; 1 Cor 7:12; as are found, for example, in
the books of Job, Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes), and historical research.
Historical research deserves some emphasis as a manner of revelation since, in the minds
of some, an inspired writer is not supposed to do any borrowing or compilation in writing the
Book, or even to employ secretarial or editorial assistance.
Contrary to this view, the Bible clearly indicates that inspired writers quoted or borrowed
from earlier authors. All truth, wherever it is found, belongs to God. Thus, Moses records that he
used material from the Book of the Wars of the Lord (Num 21:14); Joshua and Samuel mention
that they borrowed some material from the book of Jasher (Josh 10:13; 2 Sam 1:18); the authors
of Kings and Chronicles refer to at least eight lost books that they used as sources of information
(1 Kings 11:41; 15:29; 2 Chron 9:29; 12:15; 20:34; 33:19); and Luke informs us that his work
drew on historical research (Luke 1:1-4). Because the Holy Spirit guided the Bible writers in their
selection and use of sources, these writings are as much the Word of God as those whose content
was directly revealed to them in visions, dreams, and theophanies.
Sometimes, a prophet also employed a secretary or editorial assistant in communicating a
message from God, as for example, Jeremiah employed the assistance of Baruch (Jer 36).9
3. When and in what manner was Scripture inspired? How did God ensure that the
frailty of the Bible's human writers did not affect the trustworthiness of the Bible? The answer is
found in the unique cooperation between God and His chosen human agents.
A Unique Cooperation: Inspiration
Probably the most mysterious thing about the Bible is the manner in which the Principal
Authors of the Book--the members of the Holy Trinity--were able to employ fallible human
beings as their instruments to write down, in a trustworthy manner, the message of God. This
process is called "inspiration."
Fallible Writers, Infallible Record. Some might entertain the thought that (1) the
prophetic message was the invention of the Bible writers and that (2) because the human writers
were fallible, the Bible is not absolutely dependable. In response to such ideas, the apostle Peter
asserts:
"For we did not follow cleverly devised myths [Greek mythos, a story, whatever its
significance, that has no factual basis] when we made known to you the power and coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. . . . And we have the prophetic word
made more sure [Greek bebaioteron, which has the force of "standing firm on the feet,"
"steadfast," "reliable," "valid"]. You will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a
dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. First of all you must
understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, because no
prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved [Greek pheromenoi, literally,
"carried along"10] by the Holy Spirit spoke from God" (2 Pet 1:16-21).
Peter, himself a recipient of inspiration, does not deny human will or personality in the
writing of Scriptures (the writers actually "spoke"); rather he underscores three important facts
34
about the inspiration phenomenon: (1) the ultimate source of the message was not the human
messengers' thoughts and impulses; (2) the human writers were divinely aided ("carried along")
by the Holy Spirit to communicate their divine messages, so that (3) the product of this
cooperative effort between the human and the divine was trustworthy ("more sure").
Because of the unique cooperation between God and the human writers of the Bible, both
Jesus and the New Testament Christians acknowledged that while the Bible writers employed
their own words and expressions, the final product (the Bible) had God's stamp of approval as
being truly His Word.
This last point is very important. Some modern theologians (called Neo-orthodox or
Barthians, following the Swiss theologian Karl Barth) hold that the Bible is not the word of God
but can become the word of God at the moment the Bible speaks to a person in a significant
personal encounter. In a subtle denial of the Bible's inspiration, these theologians suggest that
until the Bible "becomes" the Word of God, it is merely the word of humans, or at best a human
document that contains the Word of God. Because this position has gained a large number of
adherents, it is important to consider what the Bible itself says on whether the Bible is the word
of humans or is actually the Word of God.
Truly the Word of God. Just as the Old Testament prophets warned against those who
prophesy their own words rather than words that God has given them (Deut 18:18, 20; Jer 23:16),
Jesus also made it clear that "he whom God has sent utters the words of God" (John 3:34). The
implication is that all true messengers of God (prophets and Bible writers) communicate the
message that God has given them in a trustworthy manner. Thus, Jesus could say of Himself, "the
Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak" (John
12:49); "the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me" (John 14:24).
The repeated assertion, "Thus saith the Lord," prefixing many messages of the Old
Testament prophets testifies to the truthfulness of their messages. The New Testament writers
also make it clear that all the writings of the Old Testament prophets are indeed the words of
God. For example, Mark quotes Jesus as saying, "David himself, inspired by the Holy Spirit,
declared. . ." (Mark 12:36). Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist, said that God spoke "by the
mouth of His holy prophets from of old" (Luke 1:70). At the first recorded prayer meeting of the
early church, the believers "lifted their voices together to God and said, Sovereign Lord, who . . .
by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say by the Holy Spirit . . ." (Acts 4:24, 25).
Speaking to the Jews in Rome, Paul said, "The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers
through Isaiah the prophet . . ." (Acts 28:25).
Besides identifying God as the source of the words of the Old Testament writers and
those of Jesus Himself, the New Testament writers also testified that their own words were
authoritative because their message was of divine origin (Luke 10:16; Gal 1:8-9). Hence Peter
urged his readers to remember the words "of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord
and Savior through your apostles" (2 Pet 3:2). Paul added his voice when he said of the things
which "God has revealed to us through the Spirit . . . we impart this in words not taught by human
wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who possess the Spirit" (1
Cor 2:10, 13).
"That is, the Spirit of God did not mechanically whisper the text into the writer's ears, nor
did the authors experience automatic writing. Instead, they experienced a living assimilation of
the truth, so that what they had experienced in the past by way of culture, vocabulary, hardships,
and the like was all taken up and assimilated into the unique product that simultaneously came
from the unique personality of the writers. Just as truly, however, it came also from the Holy
Spirit! And the Holy Spirit stayed with the writers not just in the conceptual or ideational stage,
but all the way up through the writing and verbalizing stage of their composition of the text."11
35
The Spirit's guidance of the inspired writers in expressing their God-given thoughts and
ideas in their own words is known technically as verbal (propositional) inspiration. This should
not be confused with mechanical (dictation) inspiration, a mistaken theory which claims that the
Holy Spirit dictated each word of Scripture.
The apostle Paul summed up the unique cooperation between God and the human Bible
writers i his letter to the Christians of Thessalonica: "And we also thank God constantly for this,
that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the
word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers" (1 Thess
2:13). In other words, the fact that the Scriptures are inspired implies that the Bible is truly the
Word of God.
A Unique Analogy: Human and Divine
The dual nature of the Bible as the product of both the human and the divine may be
compared with Jesus Christ at His incarnation. Just as Jesus, the incarnate Word, was fully both
human and divine, so also is the Bible, the written Word, fully human and fully divine. Just as
Jesus had authority to speak, command and give life to those who accepted Him, so does the
Bible claim the same. These claims are evident in the manner in which the New Testament
writers quoted the Old Testament.
What Scripture Says, God Says. The New Testament writers often personify Scripture
with the expression, "The Scripture says . . . ." This "Scripture" was in existence even at the time
of Abraham (Gal 3:8) and Pharaoh (Rom 9:17); Scripture can speak (Rom 10:11), give
commands (1 Tim 5:18) and foresee events some 2,000 years into the future (Gal 3:8). This
startling manner of citing Old Testament passages suggests that the New Testament writers saw
something superhuman about the Old Testament. The frequent use of the Greek present tense,
legei ("it says"), to describe the action of Scripture suggests that the Old Testament "is still
speaking." The New Testament speaks of the Old Testament as if God were speaking; obviously
the New Testament writers had no doubts regarding the close relationship between Scripture and
God. By using this kind of introductory formula, the Bible writers strongly imply the divine
origin and the resulting authority of Scripture.
Paul, for example, sometimes cites Scriptures by the verb legei ("he/she/it says") without
expressly naming the subject (God, Scripture, etc.).12 However, a look at the context shows that
God is the implied subject. Similarly, in the Old Testament passages cited, God was the subject.
Another frequently used quotation formula is "God says" or "God said." For instance, in Matthew
19:5 Jesus introduced Genesis 2:24 with the phrase "and [God] said," but in the Genesis verse it
was Moses--not God--who was speaking. In 2 Corinthians 6:16 Paul introduces his Old
Testament quotations by saying "as God has said," thereby affirming that the message of the Old
Testament is the message of God. Whether "Scripture says" or "God says" makes no difference to
Paul; they all share the same authority.
The three introductory formulas we have discussed ("Scripture says," "It says," and "God
says") have revealed that the Old Testament Scriptures are a divine book, speaking with
authority. But the strength and constancy with which New Testament writers emphasize this fact
do not prevent them from recognizing that the Scriptures have come into being through human
instrumentality. We see this in another way they quote the Old Testament.
David, Isaiah, Moses, "Says." Paul has no difficulty ascribing Scripture to its human
authors. In fact, he freely quotes the Old Testament by simple formulas such as, "David
pronounces a blessing" (Rom 4:6-8), Isaiah "says," "predicted," "cries out" (Rom 10:16; 9:29;
36
9:27), and Moses "says" (Rom 10:19). Whether Old Testament prophets wrote or spoke, their
messages are quoted as Scripture, suggesting that inspiration includes oral and written
communication. Also, Paul seems indifferent as to whether the words are comments of these
authors or direct words of God which they recorded (Rom 10:5, cf. Lev 18:5).
We may conclude that Scripture has a double authorship--God being the primary Author
through whose initiative the human writers did their work. It would be inexact to say that the
Bible is a human book containing the Word of God or to assign some parts of Scripture
respectively to God and man. Scripture is the Word of God given through the instrumentality of
men. Just as we cannot separate the human nature of Jesus from His divine nature, so also we
cannot divide Scripture, claiming some parts as human and some divine.
An Unmistakable Evidence. One unmistakable evidence that the Bible has a divine
imprint is the manner in which its human writers recorded biographical accounts of its heroes and
heroines when they did wrong. Noah, the survivor of the flood, got drunk and exposed his
nakedness; Abraham, the friend of God, lied and doubted God; Lot, the hero of the story of
Sodom and Gomorrah, got drunk and had an incestuous relationship with his daughters; Miriam,
the beautiful singer and prophetess of Israel, had a racial and jealousy problem and was struck
with leprosy; Rahab, the woman of faith and the ancestor of Jesus Christ, had been a prostitute;
David, a man after God's own heart, was guilty of adultery and murder; Solomon, the wisest man
who ever lived, lived the life of a fool; Judas, one of the most influential among the twelve
disciples of Christ, was a thief and a traitor; Peter, a leading apostle of Christ, denied his Master
with curses and swearing; John, the apostle of love, called for fire to destroy his enemies; and
Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, persecuted the followers of Christ.
If the biographical accounts in the Scriptures were simply human efforts to enhance the
moral standing of some prominent men and women, the writers would have judiciously omitted
or reconstructed the negative and embarrassing aspects of those lives. "This is the way men write
history; but when the Lord undertakes to tell His story of a sinful man, He does not select a poor
miserable beggar, and show him up; He does not give even the name of the thief on the cross, nor
of the guilty woman to whom He said, 'Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more;' but He
takes King David from the throne, and sets him down in sackcloth and ashes, and wrings from his
heart the cry, 'Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Thy loving-kindness: according unto
the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.' And then when he is pardoned,
forgiven, cleansed, and made whiter than snow, the pen of inspiration writes down the whole
dark, damning record of his crimes, and the king on his throne has not power, nor wealth, nor
influence enough to blot the page; and it goes into history for infidels to scoff at for three
thousand years. Who wrote that?"13
"You find a man who will tell the truth about kings, warriors, princes, and rulers today,
and you may be quite sure that he has within him the power of the Holy Ghost. And a book which
tells the faults of those who wrote it, and which tells you that 'there is none righteous, no, not
one,' bears in it the marks of a true book; for we all know that men have faults, and failings, and
sins; and among all the men whose lives are recorded in that book, each man has some defect,
some blot, except one, and that is 'the man Christ Jesus.'"14
A Book to Trust
Inspired Word of God. On the basis of the discussion in this chapter, Bible-believing
Christians throughout the ages have always received the Bible as the inspired, trustworthy, and
authoritative Word of God. For this reason the apostle Paul wrote to the Thessalonian believers:
"When you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word
37
of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers" (1 Thess 2:13;
cf. Acts 17:11).
Against those "who think to make the supposed difficulties of the Scripture plain, in
measuring by their finite rule that which is inspired and that which is not inspired," Ellen White
warned: "When men, in their finite judgment, find it necessary to go into an examination of
scriptures to define that which is inspired and that which is not, they have stepped before Jesus to
show Him a better way than He has led us (Selected Messages, 1:17).
She urged us to reject the attempt to discover "degrees of inspiration" in inspired
writings--whether the Bible or her own writings--by ascribing some parts to the Spirit's
inspiration and pronouncing others as uninspired: "When men venture to criticize the Word of
God, they venture on sacred, holy ground, and had better fear and tremble and hide their wisdom
as foolishness. God sets no man to pronounce judgment on His Word, selecting some things as
inspired and discrediting others as uninspired. The testimonies have been treated in the same
way; but God is not in this" (Selected Messages, 1:23).
Meets Human Needs. Because Scripture is an inspired Book, it is also a true and
dependable book. "The Bible is more than a good or true book, however. Man may write a good
book, a true book, even a wonderful book, but man has never produced a volume that compares
with the Holy Scriptures. The Bible lives! Through its sacred pages God moves and speaks to
human hearts. It is a Book of divine origin destined from the beginning to fill a unique need
among the human family. No other volume has successfully challenged it."15
"It points out to sinners a way of pardon, of peace, and of redemption. It tells us how men
subject to like passions as we are, may yet be men of mighty faith, having fellowship with God,
and prevailing in effectual and fervent prayer. It tells us how men who have sinned against the
Most High may be cleansed from blood-guiltiness, and washed and made whiter than snow. It
tells us how we, redeemed through God's mercy, may stand stainless as angels in the presence of
the eternal King. Are we ready to heed its instructions, and find life and peace in Christ the
Lord?"16
Worthy of Our Trust. At a time when it is fashionable for Christians to "question some
parts of revelation, and pick flaws in the apparent inconsistencies of this statement and that
statement," it behooves us to follow Ellen White's example in trusting the Word: "I take the Bible
just as it is, as the Inspired Word. I believe its utterances in an entire Bible. Men arise who think
they find something to criticize in God's Word. They lay it bare before others as evidence of
superior wisdom. These men are, many of them, smart men, learned men, they have eloquence
and talent, the whole lifework [of whom] is to unsettle minds in regard to the inspiration of the
Scriptures. They influence many to see as they do. And the same work is passed on from one to
another, just as Satan designed it should be, until we may see the full meaning of the words of
Christ, 'When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?' (Luke 18:8)" (Selected
Messages, 1:17).
One perceptive church member correctly stated: "God does not give us the option of
choosing which parts of His Word to accept or reject any more than He gives us the option to
partially accept or reject Him. Salvation requires full acceptance of Him and thus His Word; and
acceptance of Him in turn requires full surrender to Him. Nothing more is required and nothing
less is acceptable to God. For it is by His Word that we know Him; and it is through this Word
that He leads us. God and His Word are inseparable."17
As Bible-believing Christians, shall we continue trusting the Word? Or shall we be found
doubting the Word?

Chapter 3
Doubting the Word
As we have already noted, for centuries the Bible has come under vicious attack from
critics outside the church. In some instances, the Bible was ridiculed, banned, and even burned.
Yet not only has the Bible survived, but Christians have also been receiving the Word as the
inspired, trustworthy, and authoritative revelation of God's will.
Today, however, an assault on the Bible is coming from people claiming to be Christians
and occupying positions of responsibility in many denominations. A careful look at the
contemporary theological scene will reveal that much of today's theological activity is directed
towards discrediting the Bible or creating doubts over its trustworthiness and absolute reliability.
Many theologians in the classrooms, many preachers in the pulpits, and many leaders in
administrative positions are subtly creating doubts in the minds of their hearers by suggesting that
the Bible can no longer be fully trusted on almost any issue.
Nature of the Doubts. Contrary to the claims of the Bible, these dissenting theological
voices allege that fulfilled prophecies of the Bible were actually written after the events took
place. The Bible's history, they say, is not historical, its science not scientific; its stories are
myths, its facts are fables, its heroes were immoral, and its ethics are not practical today. All these
they present as new views of the Bible that will bring about a greater "appreciation" of the
"beauty" of the Bible! To make this perspective palatable to unsuspecting believers, these critics
have come up with different theories to explain the nature of the Bible (inspiration) and the
appropriate method for its interpretation.
These two subjects--inspiration and interpretation--have a bearing on whether the Bible is
fully trustworthy, absolutely dependable, and completely reliable in all that it deals with.
Questions regarding biblical inspiration and interpretation have contributed to doubting the Word.
Theological Divisions. This crisis over the Word has caused division in various
denominations. For lack of standard terminology, I have described the three major positions in
contemporary theology as: (i) the Liberal (Radical) position, (ii) the Conservative
(Bible-believing) position, and (iii) the Moderate (Progressive/Accomodationist/Neo-liberal)
position.
Caution in the Use of Labels. Although the terms, "liberal," "conservative," and
"moderate" are now employed in theological discussions, one crucial point should be emphasized
in the use of these labels: the terminology is also used in, if not borrowed from, the world of
politics. Because of the political undertones of these words, and because it is very easy to assume
mistakenly that the terms mean the same things in both politics and theology, it would have been
preferable to avoid these labels altogether.
Besides, these terms sometimes have completely opposite meanings from their usage in
the past. For example, there was a time when a Christian could proudly carry the label of a
"liberal" and boast of being "warm-hearted or generous," "open-minded," or "free from
narrow-minded thinking, prejudice or arbitrary authority." But today, as we shall show, when a
Christian is described as a liberal, it connotes one who has betrayed the truths of the biblical
religion which, if cherished, can make a person truly generous, open-minded, and free.
Similarly, in the past the term "conservative" had negative undertones. In those days a
conservative Christian described a person who: blindly fastened himself to prevalent views; was
40
cautious toward or suspicious of change or innovation; had a tendency to avoid open-minded
discussions for fear of being won over to the other side.
In fact, most of Ellen G. White's usage of this term carried this negative meaning. Notice
the context in which she employed the word: "But as real spiritual life declines, it has ever been
the tendency to cease to advance in the knowledge of truth. Men rest satisfied with the light
already received from God's word, and discourage any further investigation of the Scriptures.
They become conservative, and seek to avoid discussion" (Counsels to Writers and Editors, p.
38; cf. Testimonies to the Church, 5:706, 370; The Signs of the Times, December 10, 1894).
Ellen G. White's uncomplimentary use of the term conservative in other citations could
aptly describe today's theological liberals! For instance, she classed the "conservatives" in her day
among: the "worldly" and "superficial" class; those whose influence retard the progress of God's
work by putting "worldly conformity" first and God's cause second, or whose sympathies are
with the enemies of God's truth;1 those who instead of being true to biblical convictions would
rather shape the scriptural message "to please the minds of the unconsecrated";2 those who betray
the cause of truth by compromises and concessions;3 those who choose to be "self-centered,"
instead of "living the unselfish life of Christ";4 and those who defer to the "traditions received
from educated men, and from the writings of great men of the past," instead of seeking guidance
from the "holy principles revealed in the word of God."5
Because the theological labels--liberal, conservative, and moderate--also describe
political views, and because today the usage of these terms often varies from its use in the past,
our own preference would have been the following terms: Bible-rejecters, Bible-believers, and
Bible-doubters. However, we have chosen to maintain the above theological labels because,
rightly or wrongly, they are the best known.
To avoid confusing the three warring factions in the Christian church's ongoing quarrel
over the Word, we shall now (a) briefly describe each of the theological divisions and (b) explain
why they are engaged in this family feud.
The Three Major Theological Factions
Liberals: Bible Rejecters. Theological liberals deny the full trustworthiness of the Bible.
Seeking to accommodate Bible truth to modern culture or science, they deny the validity of
miracles and the supernatural, adopting the methods of higher criticism as the way to restore the
truthfulness of the Bible. In terms of numbers, the liberals are relatively few, but they hold
prominent positions in various theological institutions and sometimes in the churches.
Their impact stems largely from their published articles, books, and commentaries on the
Bible. These works are regarded as the standard criteria for scholarship, and those who do not
accord with them are treated as academic misfits. Because their publications tend to be reference
works, when new believers or untrained students are exposed to them their faith in the Bible and
its teachings is shaken.
Conservatives: Bible Believers. Theological conservatives, as their name implies, seek
to conserve or preserve the traditional view of Scripture against the newer views. This does not
mean that they accept tradition uncritically or that they refuse to be open to new ideas. Rather,
they aim to preserve the view of Scripture set forth in the inspired Word and which has been the
consensus of Christendom from its very beginning until modern times. Bible-believing
conservatives accept the full reliability and trustworthiness of the Bible in matters of salvation as
well as on any other subject the Bible touches upon. Their view of the Scriptures is described in
the previous chapter. Conservative scholars also reject even a moderate use of the higher critical
methodologies.
41
As a conservative denomination, Seventh-day Adventists historically have affirmed their
faith in the inspiration, unity, authenticity, and authority of the Bible as the Word of God in its
totality. The very first of our Fundamental Beliefs reads: "The Holy Scriptures, Old and New
Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration through holy men of God
who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to
man the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the infallible revelation of
His will. They are the standard of character, the test of experience, the authoritative revealer of
doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history."6 The conservative implications of
this fundamental belief are reflected in the 1986 "Methods of Bible Study Report" voted by
church leaders in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (see Appendix C).
Generally, a large majority of church members tend to be conservative Bible-believing
Christians. Recognizing the power of Christ in their own lives, they submit to the authority of
their Savior and His written Word. In their search to know Christ and His Word better, these
Christian believers sometimes find themselves confused and shaken by the discordant notes of
liberals and moderates in the church.
Moderates or Accommodationists: Bible-Doubters. Theological moderates give the
appearance of being conservatives, and yet they hold onto a liberal agenda. Because they
accommodate conservative beliefs to liberal thought, moderates can very well be described as
"accommodationists." Unlike liberals, moderates accept some or even all of the Bible's miracles
and supernatural events, but they maintain that the Bible is not fully reliable in everything it says
since it contains some minor "mistakes," "discrepancies," "inconsistences," "inaccuracies" or
even "errors."
By "errors" they do not simply refer to the ones that apparently crept into the text during
the process of copying the manuscripts (e.g., occasional discrepancies due to copyist glosses,
slips, misspellings, etc.) and which can be ascertained and corrected by comparing the various
available manuscripts.7 When moderates/accommodationists speak of errors or discrepancies,
they are referring to mistakes that are purported to have originated with the Bible writers
themselves. These alleged errors include statements in the Bible that deal with chronology,
numbers, genealogy, history, geography, and science, which the scholars insist are inaccurate.
Moderates, however, argue that these "inaccuracies" are few and largely trivial factual
mistakes. They also add that in the areas of religion and ethics, and especially in the central
teachings regarding God, Christ, and salvation, the Bible is most dependable. Those in this group
generally believe that it is possible to make a moderate use of the critical methodologies.8
Although the moderates do not come out as strongly as the radical liberals, yet in subtle
ways they present modified and popular versions of liberalism to unsuspecting believers.
Moderates tend to occupy high positions in the church where their neo-liberal influence is felt in
the classrooms, in the pulpits, and in administrative decision-making positions. Therefore, when
many church members speak of "liberals," they are actually referring to these
"accommodationists" in their churches.
The Issue Dividing the Factions
All the three factions--theological liberals, moderates/accommodationists, and
conservatives--claim to take the Bible very seriously. The quarrel over the Word started when
some confronted seemingly unresolvable difficulties in Scripture. While the three groups all
claimed that in the face of difficulties they would allow the Bible to speak for itself, it became
apparent that letting the Bible "speak for itself" meant different things to liberals and
accommodationists on the one hand and to Bible-believing conservatives on the other.
42
Unlike conservatives who take very seriously the claims of the Bible to be truthful,
liberals and accommodationists who come across difficulties in the Bible do three things. (1)
They declare these problems as inaccuracies, contradictions, or errors. (2) Then, to account for
these alleged errors or contradictions in the Bible, they redefine the meaning of inspiration or the
nature of the Bible to allow for the possibility of mistakes or inaccuracies in the Bible. (3) They
adopt different versions of the higher-critical methodology as appropriate in resolving the
scriptural difficulties. This situation has led to doubting the Word.
In order to appreciate fully how both kinds of liberalism--classical and
moderate/accommodationist--are sowing seeds of skepticism regarding Scripture's inspiration,
trustworthiness, and authority, we must briefly summarize what both camps of liberalism are
saying about the Bible and its message.
Classical Liberalism's View of the Bible
The crisis of identity we face in the Seventh-day Adventist church arises from the fact
that some in our midst want us to use liberalism's method of biblical interpretation. In this effort
they have questioned not only the Bible's own inspiration, trustworthiness, and authority, but also
other fundamental beliefs that are established on the Bible. Before we discuss the assumptions of
liberalism's historical-critical method of interpretation, it may be helpful to examine portions of
an important essay by the German New Testament professor, Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976), one
of the twentieth century's foremost liberal scholars.
In an influential 1941 article entitled "New Testament and Mythology," Bultmann argued
that much of the New Testament is myth that has come down to us from a "pre-scientific" age.
He maintained that the New Testament contains both the true gospel of Jesus Christ (called
"kerygma") and some statements that employ fanciful mythological images typical of ancient
pre-scientific ways of thinking.
According to Bultmann, since much of the New Testament contains these outdated
myths, the only way to make the Bible appealing to modern twentieth-century culture is to
de-mythologize it. Using higher criticism (generally termed "historical-critical method"), this
approach denies miracles and the essentials of the Christian faith--the virgin birth, atonement,
resurrection, ad second coming of Christ.
A Classical Liberal's View. The following is a sampling of Rudolf Bultmann's article in
which he argued for the necessity of "demythologization":
"Modern thought as we have inherited it provides us with a motive for criticizing the New
Testament view of the world.
"Man's knowledge and mastery of the world have advanced to such an extent through
science and technology that it is no longer possible for anyone seriously to hold the New
Testament view of the world--in fact, there is hardly anyone who does. . . . No one who is old
enough to think for himself supposes that God lives in a local heaven. There is no longer any
heaven in the traditional sense of the word. . . . We can no longer look for the return of the Son of
Man on the clouds of heaven or hope that the faithful will meet him in the air (1 Thess. 4:15ff).
"Now that the forces and laws of nature have been discovered, we can no longer believe
in spirits, whether good or evil. . . . Sickness and the cure of disease are likewise attributable to
natural causation; they are not the result of demonic activity or of evil spells. The miracles of the
New Testament have ceased to be miraculous. . . .
"It is impossible to use electric light and the wireless and to avail ourselves of modern
medical and surgical discoveries, and at the same time to believe in the New Testament world of
daemons and spirits. . . .
43
"The mythical eschatology [view of last day events] is untenable for the simple reason
that the parousia [appearance] of Christ never took place as the New Testament expected. History
did not come to an end, and, as every schoolboy knows, it will continue to run its course. Even if
we believe that the world as we know it will come to an end in time, we expect the end to take the
form of a natural catastrophe, not of a mythical event such as the New Testament expects. . . .
"Again, the biblical doctrine that death is the punishment of sin is equally abhorrent to
naturalism and idealism, since they both regard death as a simple and necessary process of nature.
. . . Human beings are subject to death even before they have committed any sin. And to attribute
human mortality to the fall of Adam is sheer nonsense, for guilt implies personal responsibility,
and the idea of original sin as an inherited infection is sub-ethical, irrational, and absurd.
"The same objections apply to the doctrine of the atonement. How can the guilt of one
man be expiated by the death of another who is sinless--if indeed one may speak of a sinless man
at all. What primitive notions of guilt and righteousness does this imply? And what primitive idea
of God? The rationale of sacrifice in general may of course throw some light on the theory of the
atonement, but even so, what a primitive mythology it is, that a divine Being should become
incarnate, and atone for the sins of men through his own blood!
"The resurrection of Jesus is just as difficult, if it means an event whereby a supernatural
power is released which can henceforth be appropriated through the sacraments. To the biologist
such language is meaningless, for he does not regard death as a problem at all. The idealist would
not object to the idea of a life immune from death, but he could not believe that such of a life is
made available by the resuscitation of a corpse. . . .
"And as for the preexistence of Christ, with its corollary of man's translation into a
celestial realm of light, and the clothing of the human personality in heavenly robes and a
spiritual body--all this is not only irrational but utterly meaningless. Why should salvation take
this particular form? Why should this be the fulfillment of human life and the realization of man's
true being?"9
The reason why Bultmann rejects many biblical truths is that those truths are either not in
harmony with today's scientific discoveries or they are offensive to the modern person's
sensitivities. Because of this naturalistic, anti-supernatural assumption, when liberal scholars
approach the Scriptures they adopt the historical-critical method of interpretation to explain away
the supernatural activities recorded--the creation account, the worldwide flood, the crossing of the
Red Sea by a large number of people, the shekinah that represented God's visible presence in the
sanctuary, the fall of Jericho, prophecies about the future, the virgin birth, miracles of Jesus,
Christ's bodily resurrection, a literal second coming, etc.
Consequently, the various approaches of the historical-critical method assume that the
Bible is not inspired, trustworthy, or authoritative. Classical liberalism's naturalistic assumption
that denies supernatural occurrences became the basis of a plethora of methods to interpret the
Bible. Collectively, these are called the historical-critical method.
Naturalistic Foundations of the Historical-Critical Method
The various approaches included within contemporary higher criticism are all built on the
following three naturalistic (anti-supernaturalistic) assumptions, all of which contribute to
doubting the Word. These cardinal principles, without which there can be no historical-critical
method, find classical expression in the works of the nineteenth-century German theologian and
historian Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923).10
The Principle of Correlation. Every Effect Has a Natural Cause. This principle states
that every event must be explained solely by natural causes, that is, by cause and effect in the
44
natural world. This means that there can be no miracles or supernatural occurrences; therefore,
wherever miracles occur in the Bible, we must either reject those sections or give the miracles a
naturalistic explanation. On the basis of this principle, such events as the six-day creation, the
exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the provision of manna in the wilderness, etc., are all rejected
or considered as theological statements--not scientific or historically accurate accounts, but
rather, history-like statements.
How does this principle explain the miracle of Christ's resurrection, for example? Since
classical liberals maintain that there cannot be miracles, if Jesus was really seen on Easter Sunday
as the Bible says, then either Jesus never really died on Friday (He may have been unconscious or
in a coma), or those who claimed to have seen Him may have been hallucinating.
The Principle of Analogy. The Present is the Key to the Past. This principle holds that
past events must be explained on the basis of present occurrences.
For instance, to the question: "Could Jesus have been resurrected bodily from the grave?"
classical liberalism replies that the key to this past event is found in the present. Therefore, a
person must go to the cemetery and find out how many dead people are currently rising from the
grave. If one does not find dead people rising out of their graves, it means the Gospels' accounts
of Jesus' resurrection could not have been true. Consequently, the doctrine of a future resurrection
of believers at the second coming must be rejected or re-interpreted (as, perhaps, a coming of
Jesus in your heart).
The Principle of Criticism. Don't Believe Everything You Hear or Read. According to
this principle, whenever you read any account in the Bible, instead of accepting it as truth, treat it
with a level of skepticism or accept it only tentatively, with the possibility of revision. In today's
terms, it's cool to be skeptical, naive to be trusting. After all, the Watergate and the Iran-Contra
cover-ups by past presidents of the United States have taught us that one should not trust
something until it can be fully checked out with scientific or investigative scrutiny. Skepticism is
the key to establishing truth. Therefore, as one approaches the Bible, one must begin with
suspicion rather than trust.
How does this principle relate to the account of Christ's resurrection found in the New
Testament? For classical liberals, it means being suspicious of the intentions of the Bible writers
who recorded this event. They argue, among other things, that the resurrection accounts could
have been designed to explain away the fact that the followers of Christ were misguided in the
first place in believing that He was the Messiah.
Method Denies Full Inspiration and Trustworthiness. The above three naturalistic
assumptions became the basis of the classical formulation of the historical-critical method. If the
Bible accounts cannot be accepted as trustworthy until they have been "checked out" by the critic,
one must determine how to arrive at "the truth" about what is recorded in the Bible. Therefore,
using the above three naturalistic assumptions, classical liberalism came up with various, often
inconsistent and conflicting, methods of interpreting the Bible, all of which are bracketed
together under the label "historical-critical method."
The method is based on the above presuppositions. There cannot be a historical-critical
method without an a priori denial of the full inspiration, trustworthiness, and authority of
Scripture. Take away the naturalistic assumptions, and the historical-critical method ceases to
exist.
Liberalism's Methods of Biblical Interpretation
45
Since liberal scholars hold that the Bible is essentially a human document and that the
reports recorded in the Bible may not be reliable or accurate accounts of what actually happened,
liberals have put forward several approaches (they term these methods "scientific," "historic," or
"objective" paradigms) of Bible interpretation.
Examples of contemporary higher-critical methods include:
(1) literary-source criticism, which attempts to determine the various literary sources
presumed to lie behind the present record in the Bible;
(2) form or tradition criticism, which seeks to get behind the written sources of the Bible
to the period of oral tradition and isolate the oral forms and traditions alleged to have gone into
the written sources;
(3) redaction criticism, which tries to study the activity of the "editors" of the Bible as
they allegedly shaped, modified and even created the final product;
(4) comparative-religion criticism, which assumes that the Bible writers borrowed from
the neighboring polytheistic cultures and which seeks to study the evolutionary development of
the biblical faith from its assumed polytheistic or primitive forms to its present monotheistic or
matured form;
(5) historical criticism, which employs all of the above and, in addition, draws upon
archeology and secular historical sources; it seeks to determine authorship, date of writing, and
what actually led to the writing of the biblical books; and
(6) structural criticism, which attempts to investigate the relationship between the surface
structure of the writing and the deeper implicit structures that belong to literature as such.11
Theology as taught in most seminaries and universities today is based on liberalism's
historical-critical method. This method forms the basis of many scholarly commentaries, articles,
and books and also filters down to the pulpits. Unfortunately, those who are most affected by it
are not acutely conscious of it. And herein lies the danger. Scholars belonging to Bible-believing
conservative churches and seeking to be considered "scholars" by the liberal academic
community may think that they can successfully use liberalism's methods--literary-source
criticism, form or tradition criticism, redaction criticism, comparative-religion criticism, historical
criticism, etc.--without adopting the naturalistic foundation upon which old-fashioned classical
liberalism established the methods!
This theological experiment has given birth to "accommodationism" or "moderate
liberalism" in conservative churches. Scholars give the appearance of being Bible-believing
conservatives, but because they accept the use of the historical-critical method they are actually
neo-liberals. For in order to use the methods of the historical-critical approach, a scholar
belonging to a Bible-believing church such as our own would ultimately be forced by the liberal
methodology to teach that inspired writings (the Bible and Ellen White) are not fully inspired,
trustworthy, authoritative. In other words, the use of the historical-critical method leads to
doubting the Word.
Moderate Liberalism's View of the Bible
Anglican scholar David L. Edwards, provost of Southwark Cathedral in London, is an
articulate moderate liberal. He stated his views regarding the nature and purpose of the Bible in a
dialogue with John Stott, an internationally respected Bible-believing evangelical scholar.12
Although Edwards identifies himself as liberal, he is a church-oriented liberal. His position
therefore is a true reflection of the "accommodationist" viewpoint--the kind gaining currency in
the Seventh-day Adventist church. In Chapter Ten of this book we shall respond to such views on
Scripture.
46
A Moderate Liberal's View. For now, however, we wish only to acquaint readers with
moderate liberalism's subtle skepticism towards the Bible's inspiration and reliability. In the
paragraphs that follow, Edwards states briefly what he understands to be the saving truth which
the Bible affirms. He also mentions a few things which, though found in the Bible, he considers
not inspired. He writes:
"God's purpose in inspiring the composition of the Bible which Christians hold in their
hands today was 'severely practical.' . . . It was to tell us that we and the rest of the universe are
wonderfully his creation--not to propose that science is corrected by either Genesis 1 or Genesis 2
(the myths in these two chapters, which come from different sources and dates, contradict each
other in some details). It was to tell us that we are sinners--not to instruct us how the serpent who
was already wicked could speak to Eve or how the murderous Cain, so primitive that he was
Adam's firstborn son, found a woman to be a farmer's wife or how a flood covered the earth
(including the mountains) without leaving any worldwide traces. It was to assure us that,
although we are sinners, we are loved and delivered by God--not to inform us that the children of
Israel included no fewer that 603,550 adult males plus families during the journey to Canaan
(Numbers 1:46). It was to command us to live as God's children--not to persuade us that he
dictated the law of Moses 430 years after his promise to Abraham (Galatians 3:17) although the
time spent by the people of Israel in Egypt before the exodus had also been 430 years (Exodus
12:40). It was to tell us how he used a unique people, Israel, 'people who live apart and do not
consider themselves one of the nations'--not to inform us that Balaam prophesied this having held
conversations with a donkey and an angel (Numbers 22:21-35). It was to teach us, through his
self revelation to the Israelites, that we must worship God alone--not to complain that the
genocide of the Canaanite was incomplete. . . . It was to show that the holy God demands
holiness--not to tell us that the number of wicked Israelites killed off by the plague in Shittim was
twenty-four thousand (Numbers 25:9) or twenty-three thousand (1 Cor. 10:8). It was to reveal his
holy love through Israel's great prophets--not to provide fully accurate predictions of coming
events. It was to proclaim his demand for justice--not to give us a completely coherent account of
the origins of the Israelite monarchy. It was to reveal himself in the whole bitter-sweet history of
Israel--not to recount that history with complete accuracy (somehow reconciling the books of
Samuel and the Kings with the later Chronicles). It was to show how when swallowed up into
victorious empires amid the storms of history, when exiled and deprived of all political identity,
the Jews reached a better understanding of God's holiness and mercy--not to tell us how a whale
could swallow and regurgitate Dove (in Hebrew Jonah). . . . It was to give us spiritual light--not
to affirm that the sun once halted its journey across the sky for 'about a full day' (Joshua 10:13) or
went backwards (Isaiah 38:8).
"God's purpose was to proclaim that Jesus is 'a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for
glory to your people Israel'--not to tell us whether Joseph's father was called Jacob (Matthew
1:16) or Eli (Luke 3:23). It was to say that the love of God was embodied in the carpenter of
Nazareth--not to argue with the historians about the dates when Quirinius took a census in Judea
(Luke 2:2) and when Judas and Theudas led their rebellions (Acts 5:36-37). . . . It was to tell us
that Jesus died for us (whether he died on the day of the Passover feast, as in three of the gospels,
or on the day before as related by John) and was raised from the dead (whatever may have been
the details of his resurrection, which the gospels report differently). . . . It was to speak with
converting and sustaining power about ourselves and our salvation. 'For the word of God is living
and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit,
joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart' (Hebrews 4:12)."
"Magnificent Demolition Job." Edwards' assertions may sound familiar to you; his
address is the kind heard from many pulpits and in many seminary lecture rooms today. Not a
47
few Bible-believers sense that something is wrong with this view of Scripture, and yet they do
not know what it is. They could readily discount the outright denials of miracles by radical
(old-fashioned) liberals like Bultmann; but they cannot do so as easily with this "fascinating"
view of Scripture--even though, ultimately, radical liberals and moderate liberals say the same
things. Others, after reading this "magnificent demolition job" on the Bible by Edwards, feel like
John Stott, who pictured himself as a peanut, lying "bruised, battered and broken beneath the
Mighty Liberal Steamroller!"13
Readers who closely follow developments among Seventh-day Adventists will notice that
the view of biblical inspiration presented above has been popularized in the church. Regrettably,
some have hailed this kind of doubt regarding Scripture's inspiration and trustworthiness as
"provocative, challenging, and extremely helpful in answering questions on inspiration"; others
think it is "faith-building."14 In subsequent chapters of Receiving the Word we shall highlight the
implications of such a view of Scripture for Adventist doctrine and mission, and we shall also
address some of the questions the "magnificent demolition job" raised.
Channel of Darkness. Ellen White wrote, "The plain, authoritative 'Thus saith the Lord,'
is refused for some winding sophistry of errors. Infidelity has increased in proportion as men
have questioned the Word and requirements of their Maker. They have taken up the work of
cheapening character, and lessening faith in the inspiration of the Bible. Men claiming great
wisdom have presumed to criticize and cut and cull the words of the living God, and have started
questions to make shipwreck of the happiness of their fellow men and to ruin their hopes of
heaven. This is a work that is pleasing to the enemy of all righteousness. The arguments that men
bring against the Bible are the result of the counsels of the evil one. The door of their minds was
opened to his suggestions; and the more they drifted into error, the greater grew their desire to
draw other souls into the same channel of darkness. Many claim to believe the Bible, and their
names are enrolled on the church records, who are among the most influential agents of Satan. . . .
The only safety is in rejecting instantly every suggestion of unbelief. Do not open your mind to
entertain doubts, even for an instant; bid them a decided refusal as they come to you for
admission. Fasten the mind on the promises of God. Talk of them, rejoice in them; and the peace
of God will rule in your hearts" (Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, September 22, 1910).
Moderate Liberalism: A Challenge to Adventism
The crisis of identity in the Seventh-day Adventist church stems from moderate liberals'
efforts to redefine historic Adventist beliefs according to their new views of the Bible's
inspiration, trustworthiness, and authority. Some in our ranks believe that they can legitimately
employ the historical-critical method without adopting its underlying presuppositions. But is this
really possible?
It is like saying that one can be a good Christian without accepting Christ as Savior and
Lord. As we noted in Chapter One, trying to use the historical-critical method without accepting
its naturalistic presuppositions is, in the words of one non-Adventist scholar, "as futile and absurd
an undertaking as eating ham with Jewish presuppositions."15
Where the Issue Lies. We must emphasize it again: The on-going theological debates in
our midst result largely from the cracks created in our theological foundation as some scholars
have attempted to marry Adventism's high view of Scripture with the "moderate" use of
liberalism's historical-critical method. As we shall show in a later chapter, this attempt inevitably
leads people to join the critics' subtle campaign of attacking the Bible's credibility and message.
Doubting the Word is not new. "Because of its essential goodness evil men have always
48
hated this Book. Because it champions the cause of the poor and needy it has always been
derided by callous exploiters of labor. Because it advocates the rights of the individual, claiming
that the humblest of human beings is of utmost value in the sight of God, it has always been a
thorn in the flesh of tyrants and dictators. Time and again down the centuries deliberate efforts
have been made to get rid of this Book, but always in vain. No persecution, however severe, no
subtle attacks, however cunning, have been able to destroy it or diminish its influence for
good."16
Indeed, after hundreds of years of "skeptical assault the book still remains, and the men
who are now laboring to destroy it may as well undertake to demolish the pyramids of Egypt with
a tack hammer. Infidels die, but this book still lives. Scoffers fade like the flowers and wither like
the grass, but above their graves this book marches triumphantly on, and on its pages we read in
characters of light, 'The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but THE WORD OF OUR GOD
SHALL STAND FOREVER'."17
The Choice We Face. The challenge before the Seventh-day Adventist church is whether
it will continue trusting the Word or whether it will join moderate liberalism in doubting the
Word. This crucial question lies at the heart of the theological conflicts in the church. Until
recently, when liberalism's winds of historical criticism started blowing in the church, Adventists,
by and large, trusted the Word. And there was good reason for doing so:
"Born in the East and clothed in Oriental form and imagery, the Bible walks the ways of
all the world with familiar feet and enters land after land to find its own everywhere. It has
learned to speak in hundreds of languages to the heart of man. It comes into the palace to tell the
monarch that he is a servant of the Most High, and into the cottage to assure the peasant that he is
a son of God. Children listen to its stories with wonder and delight, and wise men ponder them as
parables of life. It has a word of peace for the time of peril, a word of comfort for the day of
calamity, a word of light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are repeated in the assembly of the
people, and its counsels whispered in the ear of the lonely. The wicked and the proud tremble at
its warning, but to the wounded and the penitent it has a mother's voice. The wilderness and the
solitary place have been made glad by it, and the fire on the hearth has lit the reading of its
well-worn page. It has woven itself into our deepest affections and colored our dearest dreams; so
that love and friendship, sympathy and devotion, memory and hope, put on the beautiful
garments of its treasured speech, breathing frankincense and myrrh. . . .
"No man is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his own. When the landscape
darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the valley named 'of the shadow,' he is not afraid to
enter: he takes the rod and staff of Scripture in his hand; he says to friend and comrade, 'Good-by;
we shall meet again;' and comforted by that support, he goes toward the lonely pass as one who
walks through darkness into light."18
But while the Bible has always shone brightly as a "lamp unto our feet and a light unto
our path" (Ps 119:105), today some are attempting to obscure this divine light. The result is
uncertainty regarding most of our essential doctrinal beliefs and practices. Before we illustrate
how historical-critical assumptions are shaping theological views, however, we must acquaint the
reader with the recent interpretational (hermeneutical) civil war among Seventh-day Adventists.
This is the focus of the next chapter--how Adventists are quarreling over the Word.

Chapter 4
Quarreling Over the Word
In 1971, an insightful Newsweek article opened with these favorable words about
Seventh-day Adventists: "In an age when more and more American youths are using religion to
express their countercultural discontent, what could be more appealing to them than a religion
that forbids members to fight in wars, promotes teamwork rather than competitive athletics,
strongly advocates health foods, treats body, mind and spirit with equal reverence, appeals as
much to blacks as whites, opposes conventional Sunday worship, stoutly defends the radical
freedom of all religions and is firmly convinced that the millennium is just around the corner?"1
Strategy to Change Adventism. But the article also proceeded to mention a startling
development in the church. The magazine highlighted the efforts by "liberals in the SDA church,
who would like to recover the early Adventist tradition of dissent." According to the liberals "you
will find few seminary professors who admit to the 6,000 year theory, and many Adventists no
longer believe that the days of Creation were each 24 hours long." The liberals also charge that
"Adventists traditionally have placed too literal an interpretation on the second coming--thinking
it was just around the corner--and failed to recognize the power of that doctrine to motivate
Christians to change the world around them." And at a time when Adventists were expected to
show great interest in end-time events (known technically as apocalyptic eschatology), in the
opinion of the liberal Adventist scholars the church was "fatally afflicted with eschatological
paranoia."2
Significantly, the Newsweek article also stated the strategy of liberal Adventism to
reinterpret the church's historic doctrines on creation, the second-coming, and last day events:
"As a first step toward recovering the dissenting spirit of the past, liberal Adventists contend, the
church ought to rid itself of dependence upon an exaggerated Biblical literalism."3
So as early as 1971, the crisis over biblical interpretation was already perceptible--even to
non-Adventists. The only way the liberals could change the church's traditional doctrines was by
getting rid of the alleged "exaggerated Biblical literalism" of Adventism.
Was the church aware of this crisis over the Word? How did it respond? And what has
happened since the 1970s? This chapter takes up these questions.
Adventist Awareness. Seventh-day Adventists have not overlooked the importance of
the twin issues of biblical authority and interpretation. They have always understood that the
interpretational or hermeneutical lens through which a person reads the Bible can result in either
a clear perception or a blind deception regarding its message, leading the reader either to receive
the message or depart from it. Three factors contribute to this awareness.
First, the identity of Seventh-day Adventists as God's "remnant church" depends upon
their understanding clearly the nature and meaning of the Bible. Second, because of their urgent
mission to proclaim a distinctive message at a special time, Adventists have a keen sense of the
signs of the times which remind them that their Lord is coming soon. This understanding of their
mission and their times has made them conscious of developments around them, including the
questions that others are raising about the Bible. Finally, discussions over the inspiration and
interpretation of Scripture inevitably raise similar questions about the writings of Ellen G. White,
who Adventists believe received the biblical gift of prophecy.
As we mentioned in Chapter One, far greater than the threat of the independent right is
52
that launched within the church by the liberal left. The current crisis of identity can be traced to
the conflicting methods of Bible interpretation currently operating within the church. The
methods are: (1) mainstream Adventism's plain reading of Scripture (the historical-grammatical
method), and (2) liberal Adventism's higher criticism (the historical-critical method).
The rise of liberal methods among Seventh-day Adventists should come as no surprise,
since in the larger scholarly community anyone who does not employ the liberal academic
methodology is often perceived as "hopelessly uninformed," "blinded by a combination of ego
needs and naivete," "narrow-minded," "anti-intellectual," "pre-scientific," and even
"fundamentalistic."4 This may explain why some Adventist scholars are calling for a modified
use of the historical-critical method. But the Adventist church was not caught unawares. The
church's firm stand against the historical-critical method and reactions against the church's
position have led to quarreling over the Word.
The Quarrel: What It Is and What It Is Not
Throughout their history, Seventh-day Adventists have had disputes over a number of
issues. But even in their disagreements, they have always insisted on the Bible as the only
infallible norm by which all views are to be judged.
Thus, our early Adventist pioneers debated such issues as the identity of "the king of the
North" in Daniel 11, Armageddon, the time to begin the Sabbath, the law in the book of
Galatians, etc. In our own day, Bible-believing conservatives disagree on some details of specific
doctrines (e.g., the nature of Christ's humanity, justification and sanctification, etc.). These
disagreements often stem from an inconsistency in using the historic Adventist method of
interpretation (the plain reading of Scripture) and an unwillingness to acknowledge that one may
have been wrong.
Today, however, the key issue is different. Simply stated, it boils down to this: In the face
of theological disagreements, should Seventh-day Adventists still retain the Bible as fully
inspired, trustworthy, and the sole norm for Christian belief and practice? Bible-believing
Adventists say Yes; others who have been influenced by the higher criticism of liberal theology
say No. The conflicting responses to this question lie at the heart of the conflict over biblical
authority and interpretation.
Two Kinds of Defects. Another way of highlighting the present hermeneutical quarrel in
our church is by pointing out two major defects in Bible interpretations: (1) using a wrong
methodology, and (b) an inconsistency in using a right methodology. The present disagreement is
not due to an inconsistent use of a right methodology, but rather to the use of a wrong
methodology--namely, the historical-critical method.5
Bible-believing Christians should avoid both kinds of defects. But if Seventh-day
Adventists re ever to be criticized, it should not result from using wrong methodology but from
inconsistently applying proper methodology. Unfortunately, this distinction is not always
recognized.
The present quarrel over the Word has to do with the attempts by some to employ a
wrong methodology (higher criticism) in interpreting the Scriptures. In the next chapter we shall
show how such interpretation undermines historic Adventist teachings. Right now, we will only
concentrate on the who, why, and how of this quarrel during the past twenty to thirty years.
This chapter may be uninteresting to some readers. But those who endure and understand
this important historical overview will have a better grasp of the theological developments that
have taken place in the church in recent times.
53
Key Players in the Quarrel: Leaders and Scholars
The major players in the quarrel over the Word have been the church's leaders, including
pastors and administrators, whether elected or appointed, and scholars, such as professors of
religion and theology, editors, publishers and institutional heads. As in other Christian
denominations, these leaders and scholars greatly influence the thinking of church members,
students, readers of church publications, etc., regarding the nature of biblical authority and
interpretation. Courage of convictions regarding the Bible, or lack of it, by both leaders and
scholars sets the tone for the theological direction of the church.6
The roles of these key players in the crisis over biblical authority and interpretation do
complement each other. Church leaders play a vital role in that they hire and retain scholars in
our institutions; their pronouncements, actions, or inaction set the trend for scholars to follow or
at least give tacit encouragement. Scholars, on the other hand, through their influence in the
classrooms and committees and through published books, articles, editorials, and seminars,
educate the present and future leaders of the church--the very people who later dictate the
theological direction of church.
One must not ignore the symbiotic relationship between leaders and scholars in shaping
attitudes about the Bible. Ultimately, these major groups of people are responsible for the kinds
of teaching offered in our schools, the kinds of sermons preached in our pulpits, and the kinds of
materials coming out of our publishing houses and our publications.
For this reason, it is crucial to understand how church leaders and scholars have
responded to the use of higher criticism in the ongoing quarrel over the Word. This chapter will
reveal that whereas church leaders in the past have taken an uncompromising stand against the
historical-critical method, at least in their official pronouncements, the same cannot be said of the
church's scholars--the professors of religion and theology, editors, publishers and institutional
heads.
Church Rejects the Liberal Approach
Symposium on Biblical Hermeneutics, 1974. In the face of a growing awareness of
historical-critical challenges already bearing fruit in the church, a major effort to address the dual
issues of biblical inspiration and interpretation occurred in 1974. The Biblical Research Institute
(BRI) of the General Conference organized Bible conferences at Andrews University, Pacific
Union College, and Southern College. These conferences examined the methods of biblical
interpretation--specifically the legitimacy of liberalism's historical-critical method.
Taking a high view of Scripture as fully inspired and trustworthy, the presenters at the
Bible conferences steered away from the shaky foundations of higher criticism's methodologies
and emphasized principles of Bible interpretation consistent with the internal testimony of both
Scripture and the writings of Ellen G. White. The BRI published the results in the definitive
book, A Symposium on Biblical Hermeneutics,7 which rejected the use of the historical-critical
method.
The Rio Document, 1986. The BRI's rejection of the historical-critical approach to Bible
study found reaffirmation in 1986 at the General Conference Annual Council meeting in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. In a document entitled, "Methods of Bible Study," leaders representing all the
world fields urged Bible students to avoid the use of historical criticism in the two forms in which
liberal scholars were employing it: (a) "as classically formulated," based on presuppositions that
deny the miracles and supernatural events recorded in the Bible; and (b) "a modified use of this
method" which retains the principle of criticism which subordinates the Bible to human reason.
54
Church leaders affirmed: "The historical-critical method minimizes the need for faith in
God and obedience to His commandments. In addition, . . . such a method de-emphasizes the
divine element in the Bible as an inspired book (including its resulting unity) and depreciates or
misunderstands apocalyptic prophecy and the eschatological portions of the Bible." Because the
historical-critical method undermines faith in God, obedience to Him, and the full inspiration and
unity of the Bible, Adventist Bible students were urged "to avoid relying on the use of the
presuppositions and the resultant deductions associated with the historical-critical method."
The Rio document (as "Methods of Bible Study" is also called) explicitly stated that
"even a modified use . . . of the historical-critical method that retains the principle of criticism
which subordinates the Bible to human reason is unacceptable to Adventists" (see Appendix C of
this book).
Not surprisingly, the reaction of Adventist Bible scholars to the Rio document was
mixed--a fact that has contributed to the quarrel over the Word.
The Quarrel Begins. Generally, scholars with high views of Scripture and the Spirit of
Prophecy embraced the document as reflecting what Adventism stands for. But other Adventist
scholars found it to obstruct their agenda or threaten their standing in the larger liberal academic
community. These scholars ignored, rejected, faulted or fought against the document's categorical
rejection of the historical-critical method. They believed that they could use contemporary higher
criticism without adopting its anti-supernaturalistic assumptions (the classical formulation)8 and
overlooked the fact that even "a modified use of this method" indeed subjects the Bible to the
criticism of human reason. These scholars saw "Methods of Bible Study" as representing a
"myopic position," "altogether unacceptable."9
Many church members may not know, however, that the theological crises the church
faced in the 1970s and 1980s--over the inspiration of Ellen White, the prophetic significance of
1844, the controversy over the Sanctuary, Desmond Ford's challenges, etc.--were due to a crisis
already in progress over the interpretation of inspired writings.10
While Bible-believing Adventists discerned that the historical-critical method was the
root cause of the theological upheaval, the method's proponents maintained that the trouble
stemmed from the church's failure fully to recognize that one could use the method in historical,
grammatical, and literary analysis of the Bible without adopting its classical presuppositions of
anti-supernaturalism.
One such proponent wrote: "Most if not all the doctrinal differences and debates in the
church over the past fifty years [1930s-1980s] have arisen between those faithful to the principles
and procedures of the historical-critical method, on one hand, and those loyal to the prooftext
subjectivity and presuppositions on the other."11 "Prooftext subjectivity" is a prejudiced reference
to the historic Adventist approach.
Likewise, in the current debate over such issues as creation, the substitutionary atonement
of Christ, abortion, women's ordination, homosexuality, polygamy, etc., the issue is really over
how to interpret the Bible. Thus, whether they are aware of it or not, church members may have
shaped their views on the above issues at least in part by their alignment in the ongoing battle of
interpretive approaches between the two opposing factions of Adventist scholarship--those who
read Scripture through the lenses of liberalism's historical-critical method and those who reject
this methodology.
Use of the Liberal Approach
Liberals Are Not Bad People. The interpreters who adopt liberalism's historical-critical
method are not bad people. They are individuals experiencing what a former university president
55
rightly identified as "shifts" in theological orientation.12 Another church leader wrote: "They are
committed believers. Many of them exhibit the beauty of Christian virtues in their lives. Most of
them love the church. They would like to share the faith and certainties of our forefathers, but in
the honesty of their hearts, they do not have them. They are unable to see the uniqueness of our
message, the distinctiveness of our identity, the eschatological dimension of our hope, or the
urgency of our mission. Representing a wide spectrum of religious thought, they attempt to
reinterpret traditional theological Seventh-day Adventist thinking by dressing some of our old
doctrines in what appear to them to be new and attractive semantic garments."13
But in order to reinterpret Adventism and make it "relevant," they employ a new
approach to Scripture: the historical-critical method, which for some is the hallmark of a biblical
scholar.
Liberal Approach in Adventist Scholarship. Contrary to the recent assertions that "No
Adventist Bible scholar subscribes to that [historical-critical] method, or to its presuppositions or
conclusions,"14 the evidence points in a different direction. Even before 1974 and 1986, the years
in which the Biblical Research Institute of the General Conference and the world field leaders at
Annual Council spoke out against this approach, some Adventist Bible scholars were already
using versions of the historical-critical method and recommending it to others.
In fact, the author of the above denial had himself, eight years earlier, asserted: "During
the late 1930s Seventh-day Adventist Bible scholars began using these historical-critical
principles and procedures in their study; and today [1987], half a century later, all but a few do so
routinely."15 The suggestion that no Adventist Bible scholar follows the historical-critical method
is, therefore, an overstatement, or perhaps an unintentional misrepresentation of the facts.
Further, since the 1970s, Spectrum, an independent journal of the Association of
Adventist Forums, has been the publication to foster and advocate historical-critical views within
Adventism.16 It "provided a previously unavailable outlet for critical analysis of traditional
Adventist views."17
or example, the December 1982 issue of the journal carries an article by a New Testament
professor whose historical-critical method analysis of a parable of Jesus begins with the question:
"Can this approach--often called the 'historical-critical method'--be used by Bible students who
hold a conservative view of scriptural inspiration?" The professor's answer is Yes. His concluding
paragraph states: "Indeed, virtually all Adventist exegates [sic] of Scripture do use
historical-critical methodology, even if they are not willing to use the term. The historical-critical
method deserves a place in the armamentarium of Adventists who are serious about
understanding their Bibles."18
Notice the subtle implications in the above statement. Since "virtually all" Adventist
exegetes use the higher critical method, those who refuse to use the historical-critical method
must be an insignificant minority, if not a "fringe" group. Also, if Adventists "who are serious
about understanding their Bibles" should be utilizing the historical-critical method, then one
cannot be a "serious" scholar without adopting the method. In the same issue of Spectrum, an Old
Testament scholar begins his article, "Genesis One in Historical-Critical Perspective," with the
assertion: "The 'historical-critical' method of Bible study, used properly, can be a valid and
powerful tool for Seventh-day Adventists."19
The descriptive phrase, "virtually all," aptly captures the direction in which many North
American Adventist scholars were leaning regarding the use of the historical-critical method.
Although most Seventh-day Adventist scholars who employ the method "are not willing to use
the term," they insist that the historical-critical method "deserves a place" or "can be a valid and
powerful tool" in the study of the Bible. Thus, one scholar wrote in 1981: "The clear majority of
Adventist biblical scholars . . . favor the use of such descriptive methodologies [of the
56
historical-critical method--source criticism, redaction criticism, form criticism, and tradition
criticism]."20
Editors of Publishing Institutions. Not only academics in the classroom, but key editors
of our church publications also believed that using the historical-critical method did not require
adopting the naturalistic presuppositions. We might well expect this, since editors tend to be
selected from among the leading scholars, "virtually all" of whom were using the liberal
methodology.
Thus, a book editor of a major church publishing house likened the historical-critical
method to a valuable scientific tool: its utility or harm depends on the user.21 Similarly, the editor
of a church publication stated that "the question must not be whether we will employ
historical[-critical] methods (because we already do to some extent) but how far we rely upon
them."22
The question remains: Can a Seventh-day Adventist reasonably use a little of the
historical-critical method without adopting its underlying presuppositions? Whereas a
world-class expert in the method and a former advocate of it has responded, "One can no more be
a little historical-critical than a little pregnant,"23 some academics and editors within our ranks
think otherwise. As we shall see in the next chapter, the problem with contemporary higher
criticism lies not merely in its naturalistic presuppositions, but also in the unbiblical
presuppositions of the method which deny the full inspiration, trustworthiness, and normative
authority of the Bible. In any case, the favorable disposition of our church scholars towards the
use of the historical-critical method may help to explain why some Adventist publications contain
the materials they do.
Liberal Approach Popularized. In 1991 a leading publishing house of the church
released Inspiration: Hard Questions, Honest Answers, a controversial book based on the
historical-critical method.24 The author, an Old Testament professor, candidly admitted: "To a
large extent, this book simply describes the approach to Christian living that Adventists have
always practiced but simply have been reluctant to admit in print. If anything is unusual, then, it
is the candor with which the 'illustrations' are laid."25
This statement alludes discreetly to the historical-critical method which, as the New
Testament professor asserted almost a decade earlier, "virtually all" Adventist biblical scholars
employ in their interpretation--"even if they are not willing to use the term." It is therefore not
surprising that one biblical scholar recently noted that while "Inspiration is about the more
theological topic of inspiration of the Scriptures, at times it does deal with issues of methodology
and approach, and on occasion specifically with the historical-critical method. Some involved in
the hermeneutical debate have perceived this book as the archetypical product of
historical-critical methodology."26
Indeed, the contents of Inspiration, as we shall later demonstrate, betray its
historical-critical foundations.27
For Seventh-day Adventists, the significance of the book Inspiration lies in the fact that,
contrary to the General Conference Annual Council "Methods of Bible Study" position, a
church-owned publishing house chose to publish a book that employed the historical-critical
method.
More importantly, it was the boldest attempt yet by an Adventist scholar to popularize
higher criticism for consumption by lay-members and students.28 In the words of one perceptive
observer, "The historical-critical method had come out of the academic closet into mainstream
Adventism"! From that time on, things would not be the same again in mainstream Adventist
publications.
57
A recent attempt further to domesticate higher criticism for Adventists is the publication
of the pro-ordination book, The Welcome Table: Setting a Place for Ordained Women.29
Although it was not from a church-owned publishing house, it has been widely promoted in the
church as "a definitive collection of essays for our time from respected church leaders--both
women and men. Informed, balanced, mission-oriented, and thoroughly Adventist, this
book--like Esther of old--has 'come to the kingdom [sic] for such a time as this."30 Coming just
four years after Inspiration, this widely publicized book also evidences the flourishing of the
historical-critical method in the church--a fact already noted by knowledgeable scholars,31 and
which will become clearer in the next chapter of this book.
Opposition to the Liberal Approach
Liberal Approach Opposed by Scholars. To counter the inroads of higher criticism
within Adventism, the Adventist Theological Society (ATS) was formally organized in 1988 by a
group of conservative scholars, leaders, and members. According to the ATS Information
Brochure, "The Society's theological position is based on a literal understanding of Scripture and
also holds to the 'Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church' as voted in 1980,
and the 'Methods of Bible Study Committee Report' as published in the Adventist Review, Jan. 22,
1987. In simple terms, members of the ATS feel it necessary to say that they continue to uphold
the Bible, that Jesus died for their sins, that Ellen G. White has theological as well as pastoral
authority, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church has been called on the world scene as the
remnant for such a time as this."
ATS Annual Reaffirmations. To prevent the Adventist Theological Society from going
the way the historical-critical scholars wanted to lead the church, the ATS required its members
annually to sign seven "reaffirmations"--all of which were being challenged by liberals in the
church. The reaffirmations included a commitment to continued belief in:
(1) the substitutionary atonement of Christ--i.e., His death in our place pays the penalty
for sin, provides forgiveness, and creates saving faith;
(2) the Bible as the Word of God--"the inspired, infallible revelation of propositional
truth. The Bible is its own interpreter, provides the foundation and context for scholarship and the
totality of life, and is the unerring standard for doctrine";
(3) the use of the time-honored Adventist method of biblical interpretation (the plain
reading of Scripture), the necessity of relying on the Holy Spirit in this effort, and a rejection of
the use of "any form of the 'historical-critical' method in Bible study";
(4) Ellen G. White as possessing more than pastoral authority, and that her writings "are
an invaluable tool for illuminating Scripture and confirming church doctrines";
(5) the "literal reading and meaning of Genesis 1-11 as an objective, factual account of
earth's origin and early history; that the world was created in six literal, consecutive 24-hour days;
that the entire earth was subsequently devastated by a literal world-wide flood, and that since
creation week the age of our world is 'about 6000 years'";
(6) a literal sanctuary in heaven, the pre-advent judgment beginning in 1844, and the
identification of the Seventh-day Adventist church as the remnant movement called to proclaim
the three angels' messages which prepare the world for Christ's second coming; and
(7) faithfulness to the Seventh-day Adventist church, supporting it through tithes,
offerings, personal effort and influence.
The average Adventist church member takes these affirmations for granted. But these
very things were being challenged by Adventist thought-leaders who were using the
historical-critical method. Although the membership criteria safeguarded the ATS from deviating
58
from its stated purposes and goals, some Adventist academics--particularly those favoring the
historical-critical method--took offense at the Society's insistence on these seven reaffirmations as
criteria for membership.32
Nevertheless, through the Journal of the Adventist Theological Society and through
seminars and other works published by members, the ATS offered scholarly biblical defenses of
the historic Adventist doctrines challenged by their historical-critical counterparts. In 1992, the
Adventist Theological Society published an important book, Issues in Revelation and Inspiration,
which is a direct rebuttal of the historical-critical assumptions underlying the book Inspiration.33
Liberal Approach Opposed at Popular Level. In 1987, one year before the Adventist
Theological Society (ATS) was formally organized, another independent publication, Adventists
Affirm, was started by "a group of scholars and other interested people" to address the liberalizing
influences in the church. Believing that "a conservative approach to issues facing the Seventh-day
Adventist church is not only needed but welcome," the publishers of Adventists Affirm indicated
in their "Statement of Mission" that the publication "is dedicated to upholding the fundamental
beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist church and supporting its leadership in upholding those
beliefs" against "the impact of liberalizing trends eroding confidence in the authority of the Bible
for defining belief and practice."
The "Statement of Mission" expresses the goal of Adventists Affirm as follows: "The
purpose of Adventists Affirm is to address issues involving doctrine and practice faced by the
church, and to do so on the basis of the Bible and the writings of Ellen White. The intent is to
affirm the fundamental beliefs of our church as confessed in the 'Fundamental Beliefs of
Seventh-day Adventists,' affirm the Bible as the inspired Word of God, affirm the Spirit of
Prophecy writings as inspired counsel and illumination on the Bible, affirm the Bible-based
lifestyle and piety of Seventh-day Adventists, and affirm the leadership of the church as
appointed servants of the Lord."
Similarities and Differences. Both Adventists Affirm and the Adventist Theological
Society seek to preserve the beliefs and practices of the church from liberal attacks. Both are
mainstream conservative organizations operating within the church. And prominent individuals
who have been associated with Adventists Affirm have also played leading roles in the ATS.34
Because of the converging interests of the two groups, and because some participants in
Adventists Affirm are also well-known ATS members, the two groups are sometimes confused.
But there are two major differences between them.
For one, the ATS publications are written for a more scholarly readership, while
Adventists Affirm is oriented to a wide readership--both scholars and non-scholars. Recently,
though, the ATS launched a popular journal called Perspective Digest.
In addition, Adventists Affirm took a stand against the ordination of women as elders and
pastors, maintaining that ordaining women to these headship roles is contrary to Scripture and
historic Adventist teaching and practice.35 A significant part of this effort was the publication of
the book, The Tip of An Iceberg, showing how historical-critical assumptions underlie much of
the argumentation and conclusions of many who advocate women's ordination.36
An Important Distinction. At this point, we must make it absolutely clear that there are
Bible-believing Adventists who, while favoring the ordination of women, are also opposed to the
use of the historical-critical method. The disagreement between conservative proponents and
conservative opponents of women's ordination is not about the use of a wrong methodology (the
kind used by historical-critical proponents) but has to do with inconsistency in the use of a right
methodology, the traditional Adventist method of interpreting Scripture.37
With time, earnest prayer, and serious study, disagreements among conservatives are
more easily resolved than with liberals, since conservative Bible students are already united in
59
their acceptance of Scripture as fully inspired, trustworthy and the sole authoritative norm for
doctrine and lifestyle. Without such common ground, it is almost impossible for liberals and
conservatives to breach their differences.
This fact, though, is often overlooked in attempts to explain the nature of Adventism's
crisis over Bible interpretation. Thus, some have oversimplified the 1995 General Conference
arguments advanced by two leading conservative scholars regarding the ordination of women,
citing them as evidence that the decades-long hermeneutical quarrel between liberals and
conservatives in the church is actually a quarrel among conservatives over what some describe as
"principle" and "literal" approaches.38
The result of this mistaken analysis, perhaps unintended, is that: (1) Bible-believing
conservatives are often made to appear as supporting the liberal agenda; and (2) scholars
subscribing to liberalism's historical-critical method are mistaken for Bible-believing
conservatives. In this confusion, it is not always easy for ordinary church members to realize that
the real quarrel in the church is between Adventists who uphold the plain reading of Scripture
and those who employ higher criticism.
In any case, the continued impact of the Adventist Theological Society's efforts in
exposing the inroads of liberal thought (especially through its journal and its book Issues in
Revelation and Inspiration) combined with the work of Adventists Affirm (notably the book The
Tip of An Iceberg) in unmasking the historical-critical assumptions in much of the agitation for
women's ordination, may together have prompted a subtle repackaging of higher criticism for the
general Adventist audience.
Repackaging the Liberal Approach
In the effort to make the historical-critical approaches user-friendly to unsuspecting
church members, leaders, and students, proponents of the method have adopted several strategies.
1. A Human Face on the Liberal Approach. Historical-critical scholars put a human
face on their method by giving the impression that they alone are the champions of human
"liberation." Here the agenda of the historical-critical method has intersected with the goals of the
different forms of liberation theology--a theological orientation which seeks to "liberate" the
poor, the oppressed, the underclass, the marginalized, women, ethnic minorities, and "sexual
minorities."
While the cause of human liberation is legitimate biblically, any agenda that leads to
narrowing the Bible's scope of authority to a few sections that support the causes being promoted
deserves rejection by Bible-believing Christians. And yet, some proponents of the different
liberal theologies (liberation theology, feminist theology, cultural theologies, social gospel, etc.)
have attempted to win Adventist support to their causes in this way, as we shall show in Chapter
Eleven.
It is no passing coincidence that since the 1970s, when an increasing number of the
church's Bible scholars began adopting the higher critical methods of liberal theology, the
Adventist church has also been thrown into much turmoil over such "hot" issues of social ethics
as abortion, polygamy, divorce and remarriage, women's ordination, homosexuality, and racism.
In the debate over these issues, advocates of the higher-critical method have harnessed the
ethical sensitivities and sympathies of many good-willed Christians who are concerned about
issues of injustice (whether of race, gender, or class) into supporting the liberal agenda. Thus,
those in the church who are justifiably standing up against any form of injustice, unfairness, and
discrimination are led to believe that in order to fight racism, gender injustice, oppression of
minorities, etc., one must don the robes of liberalism. However, one can address such issues
without resorting to the use of the historical-critical method--an approach that leads to
60
diminishing the Bible's authority.39
2. Confusing an Illegitimate Method with an Inconsistent One. As noted earlier, two
major kinds of defects in Bible interpretation affect many scholarly attempts to explain the
meaning of Scriptures: (1) the use of a wrong methodology, and (2) inconsistency with a right
methodology. Unfortunately, because these two defects are often confused, the misunderstanding
has furthered the aims of those who espouse the liberal approach to interpreting Scripture.
Thus, the current quarrel between conservatives and liberals is made to appear as a debate
among fellow conservatives. Those who employ liberalism's higher criticism give the impression
that they are also Bible-believing conservatives who happen to hold different views on some
subjects.
To give legitimacy to their claim, proponents of higher criticism point to disagreements
among the Bible-believing Adventist pioneers, and also differences of opinion among today's
Bible-believing conservatives, as no different from their own cases. However, the truth is that
while the Adventist pioneers and today's conservatives are united in accepting the Bible's full
inspiration, trustworthiness, and sole authority, higher-critical scholars do not accept this position.
This point will become clearer in the next chapter.
3. Discrediting the Traditional Adventist Approach. A third strategy is to discredit
traditional Adventism's method by insinuating that it is defective. Sometimes the impression is
given that until the scholars of contemporary higher criticism came on the scene in the
mid-twentieth century, Adventists did not have sound hermeneutics. Proponents imply that
because our pioneers had not formally studied Hebrew, Greek, philosophy, and theology from
established seminaries, they could not have done serious biblical interpretation or exegesis.
Historical-critical advocates express this unjustified disdain for the Seventh-day
Adventist pioneers in several ways. In the past some have commented that "the pioneers did
theology, not exegesis"; "they employed allegorical (Alexandrian) method, not
historical-grammatical (Antiochian) method"; "they did practical or devotional theology, not a
seriously thought-out system of beliefs."
Thus, one group of authors writing as "evangelical Adventists" maintains: "While early
Adventists were clearly committed to scripture they did not understand how to interpret it. They
often used a proof-text method of biblical interpretation to defend their distinctive beliefs and
consequently missed the overall, uniting purpose of scripture as a revelation of God's salvation."40
Another author writes that "the Seventh-day Adventist church has never fully outgrown the
Fundamentalist view of Inspiration that it grew up with in the nineteenth century"--a view of
inspiration he characterizes as "a literal, rigid, propositional, or 'proof text' interpretation of
Scripture."41
A more nuanced, subtle discrediting of the works of those following the footsteps of the
pioneers characterizes their position as the "key-text" method, over against the "contextual
method."42
Some dismiss anyone who does not operate on historical-critical assumptions as
employing an obscurantist "proof-text" method. We have already noted how one author describes
the well-crafted 1986 "Methods of Bible Study" document's stance as a "myopic position,"43
symptomatic of a "proof-text method." "In essence, the historical-grammatical method does
scholarly investigation of the Bible under the control of fundamentalist proof-text principles and
presuppositions, and appears to confirm proof-text conclusions by scholarly procedures."44
Those who are familiar with the key issues of hermeneutics reject such an assessment as a
misunderstanding of the Adventist approach. In fact, a quick reference to the "Methods of Bible
Study" document, reproduced in Appendix C of this book, will challenge the contention that the
61
historic Adventist approach is a "proof-text" method.
4. Point to the "Clear Majority" of Historical-Critical Scholars. A fourth strategy for
domesticating the historical-critical method in the Adventist church is to suggest that since many
Adventist scholars in the industrialized world are traveling the "wide and broad way" of liberal
scholarship, the path being trodden by the "majority" must be right. This strategy can be very
tempting to those who crave the applause of "progressive," "open-minded" and "enlightened"
scholarship.
Statements like, "virtually all Adventist exegetes of Scripture do use historical critical
methodology"45 and "the clear majority of Adventist biblical scholars . . . favor the use of such
descriptive [historical-critical] methodologies"46 can have a powerful psychological impact. Who
wants to go against a position that is backed by an "overwhelming majority of our Bible teachers
and theologians"? Which church member, student, administrator, even Bible teacher would want
to be scorned as belonging to an uneducated, uninformed, "out-of-touch," "ultra-conservative,"
"extremist," or "fundamentalist" group of Adventist scholars?
Notice how the alleged "clear majority" often dismisses scholars who are traveling "the
strait and narrow way" of traditional Seventh-day Adventism. Even though the approach of
mainstream Adventism is consistent with the sola scriptura of the sixteenth-century Reformers,
William Miller, and Ellen G. White, and even though their plain reading of Scripture (the
historical-grammatical method) is shared by a majority of church members around the world,
observe how a historical-critical author refers to the traditional Adventist approach: "the
historical-grammatical method has gained [should have read "has retained"] only limited
acceptance among Adventist scholars."47
The subtle implication is that the historic Adventist approach is defective because it is not
embraced by historical critical scholars! Some have wondered how Joshua and Caleb would vie
this approach (Num 13 & 14).
5. Dress the Historical-Critical Method in a New Garment. As the faithful phalanx of
Adventist scholars, represented by such groups as the Adventist Theological Society and
Adventists Affirm, continues to expose the bankruptcy of the historical-critical method, one author
has suggested that the term "historical-critical method" be dropped altogether, ostensibly because
it is so loaded and so often misunderstood.48 He seems to assume that if the expression is not
employed, the method will cease to be identified as historical-critical.
Others have also simply dropped the word "critical" in the phrase "historical-critical
method." Thus one author, who in earlier years had praised the historical-critical method, now
insists that "no real Adventist scholar follows this [historical-critical] method."49 What method,
then, do "real" Adventist scholars follow? He answers: "The majority of Seventh-day Adventist
Bible scholars correctly follow the historical method of research-level Bible study"!50
Other Bible teachers prefer to disguise the historical-critical method as "historical
analysis," "serious exegesis," "boldly studying the Bible," etc.
6. Suggest User-Friendly Labels. At the same time that the traditional Adventist
approach is being frowned upon as a pre-scientific "proof-text," "fundamentalist," "key-text"
method, several new labels have surfaced for the more "progressive" methods. Among these are:
"principle approach," "contextual approach," "matured approach," "developmental approach,"
"progressive approach," "dynamic approach," "commonsense approach," "casebook approach,"
etc.
Regrettably, those who use these new labels fail to show how these new approaches differ
from the historical-critical method favored by many North American Bible scholars. Neither do
62
they explain whether these methods accept the Bible as fully inspired, trustworthy, and the solely
authoritative norm for Adventist doctrine and practice--the key test for evaluating the biblical
legitimacy of hermeneutical methods.
Although the immediate context for many of these new attempts to introduce new
approaches into the Adventist church has been the debate over such issues as the Genesis creation
account, racism, polygamy, abortion, war, divorce and remarriage, homosexuality, and women's
ordination, it is the question of women's ordination more than any other which has popularized
the expression, "principle approach."
This approach is said to be favored in the "matured" regions of the worldwide Adventist
church. Adventists who live outside the "matured" regions of the world church allegedly follow a
"literal approach."
"Principle-Based Approach": A Mature Approach?
Startling Comments. As we pointed out in "To the Reader," one Adventist professor
commented shortly after the 1995 General Conference session in Utrecht, the Netherlands, that
the vote refusing the North American Division's requesting the ordination of women was due to
the use of "scriptural literalism, a view largely held in the developing world--Africa and much of
South America and Inter-America." He contrasted this with a "principle-based approach to
Scripture" followed in areas where the church "has matured for a century and a half" (i.e., North
America, Europe, and perhaps Australia).51
Again, as we noted, a former editor suggests that those who do not subscribe to the
so-called "principle-based approach" cannot think. Thus, while applauding the "principle-based
approach" as one which requires a "high level of abstract thinking," he intimates that those who
employ the "literal approach" are immature.
According to this former editor, "Most people have not learned to reason abstractly. This
is why the literal approach is so appealing. Children begin with concrete and literal
understandings of life. It is not until around 10 years and older that they can begin to
conceptualize and reason in the abstract. If people learn only the proof-text method of Bible study
they will never develop a principle-based approach and will always remain children in their
understanding. The method that rules in the coming years will determine whether the Adventist
church will continue to grow and mature or whether it will always remain in an infantile state."52
Legitimate Questions. We may ask: If following the Bible's teaching on role
differentiation in both the home and the church will make Bible-believers "always remain
children in their understanding" and leave them "in an infantile state," does not their attitude
commend them to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? He Himself declared: "Verily I say unto
you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the
kingdom of heaven" (Matt 18:3,4). Could it be that the ultimate issue in the hermeneutical debate
has nothing to do with scholarly enlightenment (the so-called "abstract thinking") but everything
to do with conversion and humility of heart as one approaches God's sacred Word?
How can we harmonize the undertones of cultural conceit (some would say "veiled
racism") in the above statements with the self-proclaimed "ethical sensitivity" of other proponents
of a "principle-based approach," who decry the "terrible thing" that happened in Utrecht? "We
who have grown and progressed in our faith development to understand and value racial and
gender equality and justice are hurt by the lack of understanding, intolerance and animosity that
was displayed at Utrecht. . . . The ministry of sensitive and caring men and women who voted to
support this action [for women's ordination] feel hurt by the abuse that was so forcefully and
63
overwhelmingly hurled at them here in Utrecht."53
Not all will agree with the statement's characterization of what happened at Utrecht. But
our concern here is to note the words such as "progress," "growth," "maturity," etc., in the
language of proponents of the "principle-based approach." In the next chapter, we shall explore
the possible evolutionary assumptions undergirding this language.
Readers may want to know to what extent this "principle approach" is related to the
historical-critical method followed by the alleged "clear majority" of North American Adventist
scholars. Also, to what extent is the "literal approach," the so-called "proof-text method" of Bible
study in the "developing world," related to the traditional Adventist plain reading of Scripture
(the historical-grammatical method) that higher critical scholars dismiss also as a "proof-text"
method?
The Crucial Issues in the Debate
No matter how one defines "growth," "progress," "maturity," "sensitive," "infantile,"
"principle," "literal," and "proof-text" in the above statements, there is no doubt that, indeed, "the
method that rules in the coming years will determine whether the Adventist church will continue
to grow and mature or whether it will always remain in an infantile state."54 What is really at
stake in this crisis over biblical interpretation is the identity, message, and mission of the
Seventh-day Adventist movement.
The crucial issues are these: Is the Bible fully inspired, trustworthy, and the sole authority
for the Christian believer? Are the new approaches viable alternatives to the historic Adventist
method? The questions, then, have to do with the inspiration and interpretation of Scripture.
What the Church Did. In addressing these crucial issues, we need to be reminded again
of key events in our recent history. Since the 1950s, as more of the church's scholars began using
the higher critical approaches of liberal theology, the church has seen increasing challenges to its
distinctive truths--the prophetic significance of 1844, the necessity and relevance of the
Sanctuary doctrine, the inspiration of Ellen G. White, etc. And beginning in the 1970s, the church
has experienced turmoil over such contemporary issues as abortion, polygamy, divorce and
remarriage, women's ordination, homosexuality, etc.
What did the church do when it discovered that its theological house was crumbling?
Rather than simply offering some cosmetic changes to embellish the crumbling walls, the church
chose to identify the cause of the problem and attempted to repair the theological damage.
Thus in 1974, the church leaders and scholars--the key players in the quarrel over the
Word--traced the problem to the church's theological foundation: the inspiration, trustworthiness,
and sole authority of the Bible. At the Bible Conferences that year, they took an uncompromising
stand against the historical-critical method. Given the influence of the historical-critical scholars,
this decision required the courage of biblical convictions. But they rose to the occasion,
publishing a book, A Symposium on Biblical Hermeneutics, which laid the groundwork for the
1986 Annual Council document, "Methods of Bible Study."
The Result of an Unwavering Decision. As a result of the church's unwavering decision,
some individuals who had earlier believed in the higher critical methodology experienced
conversion and abandoned it.
One such scholar is the current chairman of the Old Testament department of the
Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary. He recounted something of his pilgrimage from
using the historical-critical method to giving it up as a result of the 1974 Bible Conference:
"While attending that conference, I awoke as from a dream. I came to realize that my
64
approach to the Scriptures had been much like Eve's approach to God's spoken word. She was
exhilarated by the experience of exercising autonomy over the word of God, deciding what to
believe and what to discard. She exalted her human reason over divine revelation. When she did
so, she opened the floodgates of woe upon the world. Like Eve, I had felt the heady ecstasy of
setting myself up as the final norm, as one who could judge the divine Word by my rational
criteria. Instead of the Word judging me, I judged the Word." He concluded: "I am now
convinced that the issue of the authority of Scripture is basic to all other issues in the church. The
destiny of our church depends on how its members regard the authority of the Bible."55
Implications for the Future. Indeed, the destiny of our church depends on how its
members regard the authority of the Bible. Therefore, to understand how skepticism over
Scripture's full inspiration, trustworthiness, and normative authority is impacting upon the
identity and mission of the Seventh-day Adventist movement, it will be important for us to show
from published works how attitudes toward Scripture are shaping the theological quarrels in the
church. Only then can we fully appreciate how liberal presuppositions are contributing to a
departing from the Word.

5. These two defects of interpretation plague Bible students. The first defect is the
use of a wrong methodology. This is the case with those who employ the various aspects of
historical-critical methodology. Inasmuch as this approach to Scripture denies the full inspiration,
trustworthiness, and sole authority of the Bible, Seventh-day Adventists cannot legitimately
employ this method in any of its forms. Those who do so will acknowledge, for example, that the
Bible really teaches a literal six-day creation, a worldwide flood in Noah's day, the virgin birth,
resurrection and second coming of Christ. But they may refuse to accept the truthfulness of these
events, choosing instead to reconstruct their own version of these events. The problem with this
approach is that it is established on a theological foundation of distrust in the reliability of the
Bible. Therefore, anyone who attempts to explain the Scriptures with this methodology is
building a theological house on sand. No matter how beautiful or impressive the outside structure
appears, such a theological house cannot stand the storm.
The second kind of defect in biblical interpretation is the failure to live up to the
demands of a right method, such as applying a right method inconsistently. For example, a
Sunday-keeping Christian who believes in the eternal validity of the Ten Commandments and yet
chooses to ignore the seventh-day Sabbath is inconsistent. A person who believes in the
resurrection of the dead at the second-coming of Christ and yet holds to a doctrine that when
people die they go straight to heaven or hell is inconsistent. An Adventist who keeps the
seventh-day Sabbath as a memorial of creation and yet denies that God actually created the world
in six literal days is inconsistent. The Christian who believes that all Scripture is inspired by the
Holy Spirit and yet maintains that some parts of the Bible are human opinion or culturally
conditioned is inconsistent. At times, such inconsistencies may stem from wrong practices in the
interpreter's lifestyle. See P. Gerard Damsteegt, "Ellen White, Lifestyle, and Scripture
Interpretation," in a forthcoming issue of Journal of the Adventist Theological Society.
65
Unlike the defect of the first kind in which an interpreter builds on a wrong
methodological foundation, in the second kind of defect the foundation is sound, but the structure
itself is not stable. Therefore, a person who adopts the second kind of approach is like one who
constructs a theological house using straw instead of bricks. In times of storm, the foundation
may survive but the straw structure itself will be swept away.

8. For example, in 1981 a delegation of North American Bible scholars met in
Washington, D.C. and affirmed that "Adventist scholars could indeed use the descriptive [aspects
of the historical-critical] method (e.g., source criticism, redaction criticism, etc.) without adopting
the naturalistic presuppositions affirmed by the thorough-going practitioners of the method." See
Alden Thompson, "Are Adventists Afraid of Bible Study?" Spectrum 16/1 (April 1985): 58, 56;
see also his "Theological Consultation II," Spectrum 12/2 (December 1981):40-52; Inspiration:
Hard Questions, Honest Answers (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald, 1991), pp. 271-272.
9. Raymond F. Cottrell, "Blame it on Rio: The Annual Council Statement on
Methods of Bible Study," Adventist Currents, March 1987, p. 33; cf. Jerry Gladson, "Taming
Historical Criticism: Adventist Biblical Scholarship in the Land of Giants," Spectrum 18/4 (April
1988):19-34. In Cottrell's opinion, "The majority of Adventist Bible scholars--who now follow
the historical-critical method and who aspire to be as objective as possible--enter upon their study
with presuppositions that affirm the inspiration and authority of the Bible; and as a result their use
of the method not only leads to a more accurate understanding of it, but contrary to the Annual
Council statement, honors the divine element of Scripture, fortifies faith, and calls for obedience"
("Blame It on Rio," 33; cf. his "1844 Revisionists Not New: President Indicts the Church's
Scholars," Adventist Today, January-February 1995, p. 16). Later in this book, as we set forth the
evidence, readers will be in a better position to judge whether, indeed, the historical-critical
method upholds full inspiration and full authority of the Bible and whether it leads to faith and
obedience, as Cottrell suggests.
10. When in 1979 Desmond Ford raised questions about the church's sanctuary
doctrine, it became apparent that three critical issues were involved in his challenge: (1) Were
Ford's views merely doctrinal in nature, (2) were they dictated by his theological methodology
(including his view of revelation, inspiration, and interpretation) or (3) both? At Consultation I, a
meeting between the church's scholars and the denominational leaders at Glacier View, Colorado,
in 1980, the doctrinal issue was discussed. The methodological issue as it related to inspiration
was the focus of Consultation II, the meeting between the scholars and the denominational
leaders in Washington, D.C., from September 30 to October 3, 1981.
At this second meeting the church's biblical scholars came up with a "consensus"
statement to the effect that "the descriptive aspects of the so-called historical critical method
could indeed be separated from naturalistic presuppositions and thus could be used by Adventist
scholars" (see Alden Thompson, Inspiration: Hard Questions, Honest Answers [Hagerstown,
Md.: Review and Herald, 1991], pp. 271-272; cf. "Theological Consultation II," Spectrum 12/2
[December 1981]:40-52.). Note that the "consensus" statement was "framed largely by
66
proponents of the historical-critical method among Seventh-day Adventist biblical scholars" (see
Richard M. Davidson, "Revelation/Inspiration In the Old Testament: A Critique of Alden
Thompson's 'Incarnational' Model," Issues in Revelation and Inspiration, ed. Frank Holbrook and
Leo Van Dolson [Berrien Springs, Mich.: Adventist Theological Society Publications, 1992], p.
106).
The 1986 Rio Document ("Methods of Bible Study") was the church's definitive
statement on the methodological issue arising from the theological crises of the 1970s and 1980s.
11. Raymond F. Cottrell, "Blame It On Rio: Annual Council Statement on Methods
of Bible Study," p. 33. He notes that "during the late 1930s Seventh-day Adventist Bible scholars
began using these historical critical principles and procedures in their study; and today, half a
century later, all but a very few do so routinely" (ibid.).

repeats: "No real Adventist scholar follows this [historical-critical] method" (ibid., p. 80;
emphasis his).
15. Cottrell, "Blame It On Rio," p. 33. Since at least 1977 Cottrell has employed the
euphemism "historical method," to refer to the historical-critical method. He argues that it is a
method employed by conservatives, liberals, and Ellen White (see Cottrell, "Smoothing the Way
to Consensus," Review and Herald, March 31, 1977, p. 18; "The Historical Method of
Interpretation," Review and Herald, April 7, 1977, pp. 17-18; "A Subtle Danger in the Historical
Method," Review and Herald, April 14, 1977, p. 12). His recent article uses the terms "historical
method of research" or "historical method" to describe his historical-critical approach (see
Cottrell, "A Guide to Reliable Interpretation," The Welcome Table, pp. 80, 84). Jerry Gladson
correctly observed that Cottrell's "historical" method, which is essentially the same as his own, is
actually a modified use of the historical-critical method. See Jerry Gladson, "Taming Historical
Criticism: Adventist Biblical Scholarship in the Land of Giants," Spectrum 18/4 (April 1988):34,
note 65.
16. In a well-documented study, Alberto R. Timm, a scholar in Adventist studies,
noted that the Association of Adventist Forums and its Spectrum magazine became the main
forum for those who assumed a "revisionist-critical stand" on the church's understanding of the
inspiration of Bible writers and Ellen White: "Several articles advocating encounter revelation
and the use of the historical-critical method came out in Spectrum, setting the agenda for many
discussions on inspiration during the period under consideration (1970-1994)." He backed this up
by citing all the articles published in this magazine that had historical-critical assumptions. See
Alberto R. Timm, "History of Inspiration in the Seventh-day Adventist Church (1844-1994)," a
paper read at the 1993 Scholars' Convention of the Adventist Theological Society, Silver Spring,
Md., November 19, 1993, pp. 57-58. An extended bibliography of such historical-critical works
is found in footnotes that fill pages 63-67. For a history of inspiration in the Adventist church
from 1844-1915, see Timm's "History of Inspiration in the Adventist Church," Journal of the
Adventist Theological Society 5/1 (Spring 1994):180-195. The Seventh-day Adventist church's
position dissociating itself from Spectrum is found in Neal C. Wilson's statement at the 1984
Annual Council. See Myron K. Widmer, "1984 Annual Council--Part III," Adventist Review,
November 15, 1984, pp. 4-5; cf. "Annual Council--1984," Ministry, December 1984, pp. 23-24.

scholars stood in the 1980s on the use of the historical-critical method in the interpretation of the
Bible.
21. Richard W. Coffen, "Taboo on Tools?" Ministry, September 1975, pp. 7-8.
Coffen concluded his article with this paragraph: "Man, as a tool builder, has invented many
valuable tools. As the inventor he controls his inventions--or should. Never must he allow his
tools to enslave and dominate him. In the same way, the tools [historical-critical methodologies]
that have been developed to help us understand the humanity of both the living Word and the
written word must never tyrannize their Christian user. Instead the Christian recognizes that, as
with all tools, they can prove dangerous. Hence, he utilizes them carefully--with his eye of flesh
on the humanity of Christ and Scripture, and with his eye of faith on their divinity" (ibid., p. 8).

a history of Seventh-day Adventist discussion of inspiration, but climaxes it in the 1981
"consensus" statement framed largely by proponents of the historical-critical method among
Adventist scholars. For obvious reasons, the author of this 1991 book failed to mention the 1986
Annual Council in Rio de Janeiro, which explicitly rejected any use of the historical-critical
method. For scholarly responses to Inspiration, see the series of essays edited by Frank Holbrook
and Leo Van Dolson, Issues in Revelation and Inspiration (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Adventist

28. Unlike the publishers of Inspiration, who failed to alert readers to the book's
historical-critical orientation, the publishers of Luke, A Plagiarist? (1983) judiciously included a
disclaimer: "The purpose of this book is to investigate a concept of inspiration not generally held
by most Seventh-day Adventists. . . . This book does not represent an official pronouncement of
the Seventh-day Adventist Church nor does it necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the
Pacific Press Publishing Association." See George Rice, Luke, A Plagiarist? (Mountain View,
Calif.: Pacific Press, 1983), p. 4.
29. In attempting to provide a theological justification for the ordination of women as
68
elders and pastors, an influential group of 14 pro-ordination authors contributed essays to the
book, The Welcome Table: Setting A Place for Ordained Women, edited by Patricia A. Habada
and Rebecca Frost Brillhart (Langley Park, Md.: TEAMPress, 1995).
30. The above statement is Lawrence T. Geraty's comment at the back of the book.
The "fourteen prominent SDA historians, theologians, and professionals" who contributed essays
to the book are: Bert Haloviak, Kit Watts, Raymond F. Cottrell, Donna Jeane Haerich, David R.
Larson, Fritz Guy, Edwin Zackrison, Halcyon Westphal Wilson, Sheryll Prinz-McMillan, Joyce
Hanscom Lorntz, V. Norskov Olsen, Ralph Neall, Ginger Hanks Harwood, and Iris M. Yob.
31. Although the introduction and recommendations of the book given on the back
cover state that The Welcome Table comprises "carefully thought-through expositions by some of
our most competent writers" and "is a definitive collection of essays for our time from respected
church leaders," others have observed that, regarding the key hermeneutical issues of women's
ordination, this volume is more noteworthy for its breadth than for its depth. For example, Keith
A. Burton, an Adventist New Testament scholar, has exposed the historical-critical assumptions
underlying some of the essays in The Welcome Table. He concludes his insightful critique of this
pro-ordination book: "The table around which we are warmly invited to sit is one that already
accommodates those who have attacked the relevance of biblical authority; those who wish to
pretend that the gnostic image of the primeval and eschatological androgyne is the one toward
which Adventists should be moving; those whose interest is on the acquisition of corporate power
rather than the evangelization of a dying world; and finally, those who confuse the
undiscriminating limitation of the familial and ecclesiastical roles that have been defined by the
same Spirit." See Burton, "The Welcome Table: A Critical Evaluation," (an unpublished
manuscript, 1995), available at the Adventist Heritage Center, James White Library, Andrews
University. In the next chapter of Receiving the Word, we shall spotlight a few of the troubling
aspects of The Welcome Table.
32. Apparently in rebuttal of criticisms and misinformation from liberal Adventists,
the ATS issued a detailed clarification about its name, goals, criteria of membership, and its
relationship to the church. See C. Raymond Holmes, "The President's Address," Journal of the
Adventist Theological Society 4/2 (1993):1-11; cf., idem., "The President's Page," Journal of the
Adventist Theological Society 4/1 (1993):1-2.
33. Frank Holbrook and Leo Van Dolson, eds., Issues in Revelation and Inspiration
(Berrien Springs, Mich.: Adventist Theological Society Publications, 1992). In all, eight scholars
from different fields of expertise responded to different aspects of the book Inspiration; the
scholars are Raoul Dederen, Samuel Koranteng-Pipim, Norman R. Gulley, Richard M. Davidson,
Gerhard F. Hasel, Randall W. Younker, Frank M. Hasel, and Miroslav M. Kis.
34. A number of scholars have had articles published by both Adventists Affirm and
ATS, but for some the involvement goes beyond merely writing. C. Raymond Holmes (past
president of the ATS) has been associated with the publication and distribution of Adventists
Affirm from its beginning, as has C. Mervyn Maxwell (former associate editor of Journal of the
Adventist Theological Society [JATS] and currently an associate editor [advisory] of ATS's
Perspective Digest); both serve on the editorial board of Adventists Affirm. Also on Adventists
Affirm's editorial board are Samuele Bacchiocchi and Laurel Damsteegt, who also serve on the
editorial resource board of JATS. William Fagal, Adventists Affirm's editor, is an advisory board
member of ATS. Other ATS appointees who have written for Adventists Affirm include Gerhard
F. Hasel (past president of the ATS), George W. Reid (associate editor of JATS), P. Gerard
Damsteegt, John Fowler, Jacob Nortey, and Francis W. Wernick.
35. The very first publication of Adventists Affirm set forth its theological reasons for
rejecting ordination of women (see Affirm 1/1 [Spring 1987]). The ATS position on women's
ordination is stated in its recent brochure, "Your Invitation to Join": "ATS is focused primarily on
69
upholding and affirming the fundamental beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists. Because a position
on women's ordination is not a doctrinal tenet of the church, discussion of that question has been
outside the focus of the Society. Of course, as in the church at large, strong opinions on both sides
can be found among ATS members; but that subject has not been addressed by the Society." In
chapter 5 part ii of this book, we shall look at some of the hermeneutical issues raised by the
ordination of women as elders/pastors.

Interpretation, and the Ordination of Women in Ministry (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Adventists
Affirm; Wakefield, Mich.: Pointer Publications, 1994); cf. Samuel Koranteng-Pipim, Searching
the Scriptures: Women's Ordination and the Call to Biblical Fidelity (Berrien Springs, Mich.:
Adventists Affirm, 1995).
37. For an insightful analysis of the key New Testament texts bearing on the women's
ordination issue, and for crucial methodological issues involved, see Gerhard F. Hasel,
"Hermeneutical Issues Relating to the Ordination of Women: Methodological Reflections on Key
Passages," an unpublished 56-page document, May 23, 1994, available at the Adventist Heritage
Center, James White Library, Andrews University. This penetrating study will challenge
conservative proponents of women's ordination seriously to reconsider their position.
38. Even though the crisis of biblical interpretation in the church concerns the
legitimacy of the historical-critical method, since the 1995 General Conference session some
have cast the conflict as between the "principle approach" and "literal approach"--believed to
have been illustrated by the two conservatives who spoke on opposing ends of the issue of
women's ordination. See, for instance, Will Eva, "Interpreting the Bible: A Commonsense
Approach," Ministry, March 1996, pp. 4-5; William G. Johnsson, "The Old, the New, and the
Crux," Adventist Review, General Conference Bulletin no. 7 (July 7, 1995), p. 3; cf. Caleb
Rosado, "How Culture Affects Our View of Scripture," Spectrum, December 1995, pp. 11-15.
Another author refers to the two conflicting approaches as a clash between the "contextual
approach" and the "key-text approach" (Steve Case, "Thinking About Jewelry: What the Bible
(Really) Says," in Shall We Dance: Rediscovering Christ-Centered Standards, ed. Steve Case
[Riverside, Calif.: La Sierra University Press, 1996], pp. 184-193). Notice, however, that others
have correctly identified the hermeneutical conflict. See, for example, William H. Shea, "How
Shall We Understand the Bible?" Ministry, March 1996, pp. 10-13; Robert K. McIver, "The
Historical-Critical Method: The Adventist Debate," Ministry, March 1996, pp. 14-17.

1970 use the "contextual method."

Interpretation," Review and Herald, April 7, 1977, pp. 17-18). Jerry Gladson correctly noted that
the method Cottrell describes as the "historical method" is actually the modified use of the
historical-critical method which many Adventist scholars, including Gladson, accept as
legitimate. See Jerry Gladson, "Taming Historical Criticism: Adventist Biblical Scholarship in

Chapter 5
Departing From the Word
Historically, Bible-believing Seventh-day Adventists have accepted the sixty-six books of
the Old and New Testament Scriptures as the normative governing authority for all issues of faith
and practice. On this foundation they have developed a unique system of beliefs, among which
are the following distinctive S's:
(1) Scripture's inspiration, trustworthiness, and sole authority, (2) the Substitutionary
atonement of Christ, (3) Salvation by grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ, (4) the Sanctuary
message, (5) the imminent Second Coming of Christ, (6) the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment, (7) the State of the dead, (8) the Spirit of Prophecy, (9) Stewardship, and (10)
Standards regarding food, drink, dress, entertainment, relationships, etc.
But today, under the impact of higher criticism, some are challenging the Bible's
authenticity, distrusting its credibility, and questioning its essential and sole authority as a
sufficient guide in today's complex and sophisticated world.
Such departing from the Word has led a number of Adventist Bible teachers and
theologians to challenge the following teachings: the historicity of Genesis 1-11, the literal
six-day creation, the inspiration of the Bible, the prophetic guidance of the Spirit of Prophecy, the
belief that the Seventh-day Adventist church is the remnant of Bible prophecy, the sanctuary
doctrine, the binding claims of the Ten Commandments, the substitutionary death of Christ in our
behalf, and the possibility of victorious Christian living. In the same vein, some of these thought
leaders see no biblical objection to polygamy, women as elders or pastors, homosexuality, eating
unclean foods, drinking alcohol, wearing of jewelry, divorce and remarriage, etc.1
Gradual Departure. As in other Christian churches, this departure from our distinctive
doctrines has not happened overnight. One writer noted: "People don't often go heretical all at
once. It is gradual. And they do not do so intentionally most of the time. They slip into it through
shoddiness and laziness in handling the word of truth. . . . All it takes to start the road to heresy is
a craving for something new and different, a flashy new idea, along with a little laziness or
carelessness or lack of precision in handling the truth of God. All around us today are startling
reminders of doctrinal slippage and outright failure. In case after case someone who should have
known the truth of God better failed in upholding that truth."2
Objective of Chapter. In this chapter, we shall illustrate how departing from the Word
has led to a challenge to our historic teachings. The underlying goal is to explore the extent to
which even the moderate use of the historical-critical method leads to skepticism toward the
Bible and its teachings. This effort can enable readers to evaluate the claim by some that
Seventh-day Adventist scholars can legitimately use liberalism's higher criticism without
adopting its naturalistic presuppositions.
This line of investigation is also crucial for other reason. First, it enables readers to
understand fully where the debate really lies over the appropriateness of the higher-critical
methodology. Second, at a time when hermeneutical jargon is flowering in the church,3 this
chapter will encourage readers not to settle for fancy, nice-sounding labels or claims without first
asking whether those approaches uphold the full inspiration, trustworthiness and sole authority of
Scripture. Third, it allows readers to assess how much they themselves may have been influenced
by the assumptions of the historical-critical method, even though they may not be crusading
advocates of the method.
72
Organization. The chapter has six parts, each of which (1) raises a critical issue dealing
with basic assumptions about the Scriptures, (2) sets forth the mainstream Seventh-day Adventist
position, (3) presents evidence of a departure from the historic Adventist position, (4) offers a
Bible-believing Seventh-day Adventist response, and (5) provides references showing the sources
cited and in some cases pointing readers to materials dealing with similar concerns or offering
views counter to those expressed in the cited sources.4
A Word of Explanation. The illustrations employed in this chapter are not chosen to cast
doubt on the sincerity of those expressing these views or to suggest that the writers cited are the
only ones disseminating such views. Neither do we suggest that everything they have written on a
particular subject is necessarily wrong.
We wish merely to examine the soundness and implications of the methodology being
used. By engaging in this line of investigation, we are simply heeding the judicious counsel of an
Adventist scholar who recently argued that in developing a wholesome hermeneutic, Adventists
who hold a "high view" of the Bible must "examine the full consequences of our theological
method lest we prove more than we intend."5
Subjecting the published views of popular and influential thought leaders to the scrutiny
of biblical investigation is not always appreciated. Factors that discourage Adventists from
examining the soundness of discordant ideas include: (1) the fear of being branded as divisive,
dogmatic, or intolerant; (2) the risk of being perceived as opposing academic freedom or as
supporting an alleged "inquisition" by "reactionary" church administrators; and (3) concern over
being dismissed as cherishing "authoritarian" tendencies, especially if one happens to come from
regions outside the "democratic" areas of the world.6
But are intimidating psychological factors reason enough to keep silent on crucial
hermeneutical issues?
An African proverb says: "The threatening eyes of the crocodile do not prevent the thirsty
frog from drinking from the pond." Fear or intimidation must never prevent us from doing the
right thing. Subjecting the theological views of fellow Christians to the searching light of
Scripture is not only an honorable thing to do (Acts 17:11), but it is also a Christian obligation (1
Thess 5:21). This is why the following pages explore how higher-critical assumptions are leading
some within our ranks to depart from the Word.
Beyond the predictable reactions from those who hold the kinds of views being
examined, this chapter may also be disturbing to those who have been unaware of the
sophisticated internal challenge to our doctrine and lifestyle.7 Yet we encourage all to read
carefully, thoughtfully, and critically (in the best sense of the word).
This book's readers, no less than its author, are accountable to God for how they relate to
the truths of His inspired Word. Therefore we urge all to read prayerfully, with an honest desire
to know the will of God and with a single-minded commitment to act upon it. The Lord Himself
has promised: "If anyone wants to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it
is from God or whether I speak on My own authority" (John 7:17).

Though informed readers may justly challenge his oversimplified analysis of the hermeneutical
issues regarding jewelry and women's ordination (the two illustrations he uses in his article), yet
all serious Adventists can agree with his admonition that in developing a wholesome
hermeneutic, "we should extend our methodology to its logical conclusions" (ibid., p. 26).

(Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald, 1991), pp. 90-95, 97, dismisses those who do not agree

DEPARTING FROM THE WORD
PART I
The Bible--Sole or Primary Authority?
Objective. This section explores the extent to which higher-critical assumptions are
influencing Seventh-day Adventist views on the use of alcohol, the morality of homosexuality
and lesbianism, and the belief in a literal six-day creation.
Key issue. Is the Bible the sole authority for Christian belief and practice or is it only the
primary authority?
Traditional Adventist Belief. Seventh-day Adventists generally have always upheld the
sole authority of Scripture. Believing that the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments are
the clear, trustworthy revelation of God's will and His salvation, Adventists hold that the
Scriptures alone constitute the standard on which all teachings and practices are to be grounded
and by which they are to be tested (2 Tim 3:15-17; Ps 119:105; Prov 30:5, 6; Isa 8:20; John
17:17; 2 Thess 3:14; Heb 4:12).
The first article of the Seventh-day Adventist "Fundamental Beliefs" states: "The Holy
Scriptures are the infallible revelation of His [God's] will. They are the standard of character, the
test of experience, the authoritative revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts
in history."
Ellen G. White wrote, "The Word of God is the great detector of error; to it we believe
everything must be brought. The Bible must be our standard for every doctrine and practice. We
must study it reverentially. We are to receive no one's opinion without comparing it with the
Scriptures. Here is divine authority which is supreme in matters of faith. It is the Word of the
living God that is to decide all controversies" (The Ellen G. White 1888 Materials, pp. 44, 45; cf.
The Great Controversy, p. 595).
But under the impact of higher-critical assumptions the Bible's role as the sole source of
authority for Christian faith and lifestyle is being challenged.
Effect of the Liberal Approach
Influenced by the historical-critical method, some now assert that the Bible is "silent,"
"inadequate," or "irrelevant" on several contemporary issues, implying that the Bible cannot
remain the sole source of authority on issues of doctrine and lifestyle. We must supplement the
authority of the Bible with experience and empirical data. A New Testament scholar voiced this
new view in relation to the abortion question: "Respect for the Bible's agenda means honestly
balancing biblical evidence with other relevant data. The Bible is not our only source of evidence,
even if it is the central controlling norm. Obviously our experience and empirical data will
condition our views, and this must be admitted."1
According to this view, the Bible is not the sole source of authority; it only holds a
priority ("the central controlling norm") over other sources--experience and empirical data.
Similarly, another author argues that "doctrines arise, not from the Bible alone, but from the
dynamic interplay between the Bible and the living experience of the church." For him, the Bible
is only the "central authority for Christian belief," sharing a place alongside Christian experience
and tradition.2 The Bible is the primary source of authority, not the sole source.
75
This shift of religious authority from sola scriptura (the Bible's sole authority) to other
sources--empirical data, experience, and tradition--is shaping Adventist discussions on the use of
alcohol, the moral legitimacy of homosexuality, and the question of life origins.
Use of Alcohol. Does the Bible condemn the use of alcohol, or is it only against alcohol's
abuse? In other words, should Seventh-day Adventists just say "No" to alcohol, or should they
simply say "No more" (i.e., "no more" than, say, two bottles of beer)?
The editor of a recent book, Shall We Dance, devotes two chapters to this issue. The first
closes with the assertion that a person's "bias" influences his conclusions regarding the use or
abuse of alcohol: "Those with a bias for moderate use of alcohol receive supportive evidence
from both Scripture and modern science. But there is ample support [for] abstinence, too."3
How then does this author conclude his "biblical principles that relate to moderate use
[of] alcohol"?4
While he makes a "recommendation" to the Seventh-day Adventist church to hold "an
abstinence position on alcohol and seek to correct the negative results of alcohol abuse
throughout our society," he attempts to resolve the question with a carefully nuanced position:
"Rather than being satisfied with the support of either position [the use or abuse of alcohol], this
chapter attempts to look beyond the obvious 'wine texts' in the Bible and consider other Scriptural
principles that would have a bearing on the moderate use of alcohol today, especially in North
America."5
Does moving "beyond" the wine-texts in the Bible for "Scriptural principles" include
going to extra-biblical sources? He answers: "For Christians, sometimes it's useful to temporarily
put aside biblical passages and simply consider what those speaking outside the church have to
say on a given matter. Listening to a different voice can give a new perspective of Scripture. For
this reason we will now turn to what people outside the community of faith say about alcohol.
While some may be Christians, they do not speak for Christians."6
The subtle message in this carefully worded statement is that the Bible is not a sufficient
guide or the sole authority to address this issue. We have to allow extra-biblical sources to "give a
new perspective of Scripture."
In the second of his two chapters devoted to the subject, the author discusses the "new
perspective" that we gain when we listen to different voices: (1) "Abstention is acceptable in all
circumstances" (it is not necessarily mandatory); (2) "Alcohol in high-risk settings is
discouraged" (but apparently okay in non-risk settings); (3) "Heavy consumption is discouraged"
(implying that lighter consumption may be all right); (4) "Moderate consumption in low risk
situations is acceptable." Indeed, some research findings on the "medical benefits" of alcohol use
suggest that "2-3 drinks per day is okay. In fact, it may be healthier than a nonalcoholic diet."7
The critical hermeneutical question illustrated by the above example is this: Should we
decide on the use/abuse of alcohol solely on the basis of Scripture, or must we also look outside
of Scripture (research findings, experience, culture, etc.) for answers? Similar questions are also
shaping the discussion on homosexuality and lesbianism.
Morality of Homosexuality. An increasing umber of Adventist Bible scholars are
arguing that the teaching of Scripture on the subject of homosexuality is not sufficiently clear to
settle the question of the morality of homosexual acts or relationships in our world.8 If the Bible
cannot settle this question, where does the Christian go for dependable answers?
The argument of one theologian was summarized thus: "Moral norms, he asserted, should
be determined by scripture, but there is also need for empirical evidence about what is. Norms
are useless in a vacuum."9 The empirical evidence alluded to is the "finding" that people are born
gay. But what happens if the evidence conflicts with Scripture?
76
If one accepts the Bible as the sole authority for Christian belief and practice, one cannot
accept homosexuality as biblically legitimate. However, a Kinsey Institute study of homosexuals
in California's San Francisco Bay Area maintained that gays involved in reciprocal, permanent,
and sexually exclusive relationships tend to be the happiest, healthiest, and best-adjusted people
of the entire group being analyzed. Based on this highly questionable source,10 an Adventist
professor of ethics concluded: "Christians therefore have every reason to encourage homosexuals
who are honestly convinced that they should neither attempt to function heterosexually nor
remain celibate to form Closed-Couple homosexual unions."11
The reason given for endorsing closed couple homosexual unions is not biblical
revelation, but rather an empirical finding about the subjective experience of homosexuals.12
Morality of Lesbianism. This new way of knowing truth (what scholars refer to as
epistemology) is echoed in the Adventist Women's Institute's book, In Our Own Words. This
work carries the testimony of a lesbian, who identifies herself as an "Adventist-connected"
theologian, Bible instructor/academy teacher-turned-minister. Observe how she came to the
conclusion that her lesbianism was "an unusual calling" from the Lord and why her lesbian
partner also believes that their lesbian relationship was "God's gift for her conversion."
She speaks about her naivete in blindly following the teaching of the Seventh-day
Adventist church that "told me that my own nature was sinful, so looking to myself would be my
downfall. . . . It did not tell me to look at the rest of the natural world and discover that
same-gender nesting occurs in many species." She explains, however, that following her "unusual
calling" or "Martin Luther experience" (the "ecstasy and torment" of her lesbian encounter), she
came to value the importance of "inner knowing"--listening to "the voice of God within me."13
Scripture, according to this writer, is not the sole authority. We need "to look at the rest of
the natural world" (empirical data) and also listen to "the voice of God within me"--an "inner
knowing" (experience). For her, subjective human experience was trustworthy because she did
not believe that her "own nature was sinful."
The above examples illustrate an increasing departure from biblical revelation toward
empirical experience as the authority base for religious and ethical issues. This trend raises
questions for Bible-believing Christians regarding the starting point for discussions on
theological issues: Should it be observation, introspection, or biblical revelation?14 One's
response has consequences beyond the issue of homosexuality or lesbianism. It determines
whether the Bible or the hypothesis of naturalistic evolution will provide the grounds for
ascertaining, for example, whether or not Genesis 1 and 2 teach a literal-day creation--an issue
that affects the validity of the seventh-day Sabbath.
The Question of Origins. Based on naturalistic interpretations of scientific data, some
Adventist scholars now hold: (a) a long rather than short chronology for the age of our earth (i.e.,
millions instead of thousands of years); (b) gradual, uniformitarian deposit of the geologic
column, instead of catastrophism (i.e., Noah's flood); (c) views that reinterpret the days of
creation to represent millions of years, instead of the six literal days taught by the Bible.15
The shift from the sole authority of Scripture to empirical data is remarkably illustrated in
the case of a former Adventist university president and General Conference vice president. After
reviewing theories of continental drift, fossil records, and radioactive isotope dating, he
concluded that: "animals [were] living in the earth . . . millions of years before these [continental]
plates separated. And, moreover, as I got to looking into the geologic column, I had to recognize
. . . that the geologic column is valid, that some forms of life were extinct before other forms of
life came into existence. I had to recognize that the forms of life that we are acquainted with
mostly, like the ungulate hoof animals, the primates, man himself, exist only in the very top little
77
layer of the Holocene, and that many forms of life were extinct before these ever came in, which,
of course, is a big step for a Seventh-day Adventist when you are taught that every form of life
came into existence in six days. . . . I had felt it for many, many years, but finally there in about
1983 I had to say to myself, That's right. The steadily accumulating evidence in the natural world
has forced a reevaluation in the way that I look at and understand and interpret parts of the
Bible."16
Such conclusions have implications. First, denying a literal six-day creation implies that:
(i) if Adventists continue keeping the seventh-day Sabbath, they must reinterpret its origin and
significance; (ii) if Sabbath observance is retained, there would be no solid basis for seventh-day
worship, setting the stage for the end-time recognition of Sunday sacredness in place of the true
Sabbath; (iii) if the Bible's authoritative record of creation, which Jesus Christ confirmed (Matt
19:4-6; Mark 2:27-28), can be so easily set aside, we can also ignore its authority in other areas
(e.g. morality and lifestyle).
Second, if animals were dying millions of years before the existence of human beings,
then death (even of animals) is not the result of human sin. But the Bible says that "the wages of
sin is death" (Rom 6:23), and that because of sin "the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together until now" (Rom 8:22). Also, if death came before sin, Paul's statement that "by one
man sin entered into the world, and death by sin" (Rom 5:12; cf. 8:22) is not trustworthy; neither
can we believe that "as by the offence of one [Adam] judgment came upon all men to
condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [Christ] the free gift came upon all men unto
justification of life" (Rom 5:18). Pursuing this argument to its logical end raises serious doubts
about the necessity and efficacy of Christ's death for our sins, the possibility of human
redemption, and the likelihood of Christ's second coming and a new creation (see 2 Pet 3:1-15).17
Thus, giving up the Bible's teaching on origins may lead to theological skepticism or agnosticism.
Agnosticism, the End-Result. The experience of a former Adventist, a grandson of a
General Conference president, illustrates this danger. In the introduction to his book The
Creationists, he explains how he gave up his Adventist views on a literal creation and became an
agnostic: "Having thus decided to follow science rather than Scripture on the subject of origins, I
quickly, though not painlessly, slid down the proverbial slippery slope toward unbelief. . . . [In a
1982 Louisiana creation-evolution trial, he elected to serve as an expert witness for the evolution
cause, against the creationist lawyer, Wendell R. Bird. At that trial, he continues,] Bird publicly
labeled me an 'Agnostic.' The tag still feels foreign and uncomfortable, but it accurately reflects
my theological uncertainty."18
In summary, the slide into the abyss of theological uncertainty begins with a departure
from the Bible as the Christian's sole norm of authority. Then follows a reinterpretation of the
Scriptures according to the extra-biblical knowledge, whether from science, experience, tradition,
psychology, or other sources. As the retired General Conference administrator himself said: "The
steadily accumulating evidence in the natural world has forced a reevaluation in the way that I
look at and understand and interpret parts of the Bible."19
A Bible-Believing Adventist Response
While upholding the sole authority of Scripture, Bible-believing Christians do not totally
reject the value of extra-biblical data and experience in informing their understanding of inspired
writ. The Bible itself teaches that God has revealed Himself in nature, history and human
experience (Ps 19; Rom 1 & 2; Heb 1:1-2). Adventists may indeed learn from extra-biblical
sources such as science, history, tradition, psychology, and archaeology.20
However, because of the impact of sin on all of God's creation, including nature and
78
human experience, the knowledge obtained from data outside Scripture (and scholars'
interpretation of such knowledge) may sometimes be flawed. To correct such distortions, God has
given the Holy Scriptures as the objective basis to evaluate extra-biblical data.
Experience is important in the Christian religion (1 John 1:1-3). But experience is not
necessarily a reliable source of truth. To avoid equating subjective religious experience with "the
Holy Spirit's leading," believers need the corrective norm of the Holy Scriptures, which are "more
sure" than any experience. The apostle Peter's manner of addressing this issue is significant. In
2 Peter 1:16-18 he rejects the charge that the Christian message is a myth with no objective basis
in a factual historical event. For proof he appeals to the apostles' first-hand experience: "We were
eyewitnesses . . . we heard . . . we were with Him." However, in verse 19 he appeals to something
"more sure" than experience--namely, the prophetic word, the divinely inspired, authoritative
Scriptures (cf. verses 20-21). Peter's approach is the very opposite of our pluralistic generation's,
which accepts the Bible because it confirms our experience--the experience is the norm. But the
apostle argues that his sanctified experience is trustworthy because it is confirmed by the
Scriptures!
Likewise Jesus, in explaining His death and resurrection (Luke 24:25-27), could have
appealed to real experiences--resurrected saints, angels appearing at the tomb, etc. Instead, He
pointed them to "Moses and all the prophets," something "more sure" than experience. The men
from Emmaus later testified that what caused their hearts to "burn within" them (v. 32) was Jesus'
opening of the Scriptures to them.
Scripture must always be the sole authoritative source of human knowledge--above
knowledge from nature (science), human experience (psychology), human history, church
tradition, etc. Recognizing that God has revealed Himself in nature, history, and human
experience should not lead us to overlook the impact of sin on these sources of revelation or to
ignore sin's impact on the human reason employed to interpret these data. Without recognizing
these limitations, admitting experience and empirical data as rival sources of truth will soon lead
us to treat them as equal partners with, and finally as judge over, Scripture.
For the crucial issue, "The Bible, Sole Authority or Primary Authority?" the Bible's
response is: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In
all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths" (Prov 3:5-6). If data from
extra-biblical sources accord with the teaching of the Bible, they should be accepted; otherwise
they should be rejected. Experience, reason, tradition, public opinion, verdicts of scholars,
leaders, or other sources cannot be our authority; the Bible, and the Bible only (sola Scriptura),
must be the sole authority over extra-biblical data.

DEPARTING FROM THE WORD
PART II
The Bible – Fully or Partially Inspired?
Objective. In this section we will investigate to what extent higher-critical assumptions are
influencing Seventh-day Adventist discussions on biblical inspiration, dress and adornment,
the role of women in the home, ordaining women as elders or pastors, and the nature and
relevance of Ellen G. White's prophetic gift.
Key issue. Is the Bible fully inspired or partially inspired?
Traditional Adventist Belief. Adventists believe that "all Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness" (2 Tim 3:16). When the Bible teaches that "in many and various ways, God
spoke . . ." (Heb 1:1), it suggests that God varied His methods of disclosing His will to us.
These methods included dreams, visions, historical research, personal reflection, etc.1 But
none of the sources of the Bible writers' messages renders their writing as "uninspired" or
culturally conditioned (2 Tim 3:16, 17; 1 Cor 10:6, 11).
The Bible identifies the processes involved in revelation and inspiration: "Knowing this
first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came
not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost" (2 Pet 1:20-21). The apostle Paul wrote: "For this reason we also thank God without
ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed
it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works
in you who believe" (1 Thess 2:13).
In the light of these passages, Adventists hold that the Bible is not culturally conditioned.
Rather, as a divinely conditioned but historically constituted document, it is fully inspired and
therefore binding upon all people in all ages and in all places.
Cultural Conditioning. In an effort to show that some parts of the Bible are not fully
inspired, proponents of contemporary higher criticism often argue that the Bible is historically
or culturally conditioned. By this expression they mean that the Bible mirrors the prejudices
or limitations of the inspired writers' culture and times. For instance, many such proponents
in various denominations dismiss the Bible's condemnation of pre-marital and extra-marital
sex as culturally conditioned. They claim that in contrast with our enlightened age, the Bible
writers lived in a "pre-scientific" era with no antibiotics for venereal diseases, and no
condoms and contraceptives to prevent pregnancies; their views were consistent with the
conditions of their times. But, they continue, if the Bible writers had lived in our day, they
would have viewed pre-/extra-marital sex differently.
On a related issue, is the denunciation of homosexuality culturally conditioned, stemming
from Moses and Paul's lack of knowledge about psychological and genetic factors that may
contribute to homosexuality? When Christians read the condemnations of homosexuality in
the Bible, should theyunderstand the Bible writers not as condemning the offense of
homosexuality but an offensive kind of homosexuality (e.g., homosexual rape and
promiscuity, or those associated with pagan practices)? Are other practices of Adventist
lifestyle--such as abstaining from unclean meats, alcoholic drinks, and from wearing
82
jewelry--culturally conditioned to the pre-scientific Bible times or, perhaps, to the
nineteenth-century Victorian age of Ellen White?2
The cultural-conditioning argument implies that in some cases the Bible writers wrote
from ignorance or a distorted view of reality. In effect, today's historical-critical interpreters
believe they can decide which parts of the Bible are inspired and valid and which are not--the
latter being the alleged culturally-conditioned sections of the Bible, not fully binding on all
people in all ages. But they fail to show by what criteria they are able to sort out those parts
tainted by the inspired writers' so-called prejudices, ignorance, or culture.
Basis for Cultural Conditioning Argument. The cultural conditioning argument assumes
erroneously that because the people who lived in Bible times did not have the benefit of
modern education, technology, and scientific laboratories, they were "primitive"--a view
stemming from the myth of evolutionism. Evolutionism is not the same as the scientific
theory of evolution. It is the philosophical theory that ideas and thought are continually
progressing, so that the ideas of today are necessarily better than the ideas of yesterday. The
English liberal scholar Dennis E. Nineham expresses such a view when he describes the Bible
as "the expression, or at any rate an outcrop, of the meaning-system of a relatively primitive
cultural group."3
Moderate proponents of higher criticism argue that since the Bible is both divine and
human, the divine part may be fully trustworthy but not the human part. They maintain that
such a view of Scripture is the best way to understand the incarnational analogy between
Christ and the Bible--for both are fully human and divine. However, they fail to realize that a
true incarnation model of Scripture does not permit finite human beings to separate the
mysterious union of divine and human or to suggest that one part of Scripture (the human) is
not fully inspired (see Testimonies for the Church, 5:747; cf. The Great Controversy, p. vi).4
One perceptive Adventist scholar captured the true biblical understanding of the divine and
human in Scripture: "Jesus Christ became a man in time and space. Yet, this fact did not
eliminate his divinity nor did it make him historically relative. In the same way, God's written
Word, the Bible, also was given in time and space. But rather than being historically
conditioned by immanent cause and effect relations, and thereby being rendered relative and
not universally binding, God's Word is divinely conditioned and historically constituted. Thus
it remains binding upon all men at all ages and in all places. It is God's Word, revealed to man
and written by man under divine guidance and under the supervision of the Holy Spirit."5
How are the two higher-critical assumptions--the cultural-conditioning argument and
doubts about the alleged "human" elements in Scripture--shaping Adventist views on the
Bible's full inspiration?
Effect of the Liberal Approach
Bible-believing Adventists hold that God accommodated His message--i.e., He expressed
His message in terms that could be understood by the messengers and their audience--without
compromising the truth in the process. The new views o inspiration, on the other hand, allow
for the truth to have been distorted.
New Views. For example, the author of Inspiration: Hard Questions, Honest Answers
suggests that in divine accommodation God adapts Himself to the opinions of "surrounding
culture"--even opinions that are false.6 Because he believes that "revelation is adapted to the
conditions of fallen humanity, [and thus] it partakes of the imperfections of that humanity,"
the author of Inspiration considers the Scriptures to have "a generous sprinkling of human
83
'imperfections' in the text," so that he finds "the quality" of the Bible's contents and mechanics
sometimes falling to a mere C- passing level on his grading scale.7
For this scholar, the fact that the Bible is both divine and human suggests that while the
divine portions of Scripture are infallible or trustworthy, the human aspects are not always
reliable. He apparently did not consider that just as we cannot discern precisely where in
Christ the divine part starts and the human ends, so also, in the case of Scripture, we cannot
separate the "eternal" divine aspect of Scripture from the human aspect.8 In the opinion of this
Old Testament professor, the various "strange" laws in the Old Testament (such as capital
punishment, the command to destroy the Canaanites) were culturally conditioned, in the sense
that God simply treated Israel according to the cultural norms of justice of their times.9
Another who espouses what he styles "a structural view of inspiration" has written:
"Personally, I believe there are demonstrable errors of fact in inspired writings." He explains
that the "distortions" he claims to have found in Scripture arise from the fact that "perhaps the
prophet did not fully understand the message, perhaps because the prophet's prejudices or
ignorance distorted the message."10 Did, for example, the ignorance and prejudices of Moses
and Paul lead them to denounce homosexuality as morally wrong? If they had lived in our
enlightened age, would they still have condemned homosexuality or fornication?
The "culturally conditioned" view also surfaces in the heated debates on dress and
adornment, women's ordination, and the inspiration and relevance of Ellen White's writings.
A few examples will illustrate.
Dress and Adornment. Is the Seventh-day Adventist teaching on dress and adornment
culturally conditioned to nineteenth-century America? Extricating the Adventist practice from
its biblical foundations, a professor of history argues that Adventists inherited the "plain
dress" tradition from colonial American culture. He explains that although the Puritans and
Quakers established this tradition in America, Adventists, under the dominant role of Ellen
White, borrowed their practice from Methodism.11
Putting a feminist spin on this issue, one New Testament professor maintains that the rules
governing female dress are yet another example of male oppression of women. In her opinion,
the Old Testament "never prohibited adornment itself." As far as the New Testament is
concerned, even though the practice was proscribed, only "lavish" adornment was disallowed
because of the conditions at that time. She asserts: "Such conditions do not exist in American
culture today. . . . Furthermore, ours is a democratic society that inculcated the equality of
women and men; we must be careful not to teach inequality by prohibiting adornment for
women while we permit it for men."12
The implication of this argument is that contemporary culture is the norm for Christian
lifestyle. A person who accepts this view of bodily adornment will logically have to accept as
morally appropriate the current practice even in Western societies of men piercing their ears
and noses in order to be "equal" with women.
Role of Women in the Home. The relationship of men and women in the home is another
issue that has felt the impact of higher criticism's assumptions. Are Paul's counsels on male
headship and female submission (Eph 5:22-33; Col 3:18-19; 1 Cor 11:3, 11-12; cf. 1 Pet
3:1-7) to be lightly dismissed as culturally conditioned, so that in our day the man is no longer
to be the head f the home? Or should Christians continue to uphold the Bible's teaching of
headship--a theological concept which means that within the loving relationship of
male-female equality and complementarity, God calls upon men to be heads of their families
and He holds them accountable if they refuse to shoulder leadership responsibilities?13
The widely distributed book Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . . , a volume described by
84
the Ministerial Association of the General Conference as "an authentic exposition of
Adventist beliefs," rightly affirms the contemporary validity of male headship
responsibility.14 But historical-critical scholarship is challenging this biblical doctrine.
Reasoning along cultural-conditioning lines, one contributor to the book, The Welcome
Table: Setting A Place for Ordained Women, claims that Paul's statements defining the role
relationships between male and female in the home derive from the Greco-Roman "household
codes." Thus, Paul's statement in Ephesians 5 ("Submit to one another out of reverence for
Christ. Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife
. . .") is culturally conditioned and therefore not applicable to our situation today.
She maintains: "Paul was a man of his own time, and utilized familiar forms to help the
people understand ways to live together, forms commonly known as the 'household codes'
that are found in [Eph 5] verses 21 through 33. . . . It seems that Paul dealt with the political
situation of his day in a way that was most conducive to the spread of the gospel. . . . Even as
we struggle with such issues in our culture, Paul worked to find new ways to live the gospel
in his. Though he occasionally glimpsed the ideal that Jesus established during His time on
earth, he nonetheless fell into old patterns [the Greco-Roman 'household codes'] of coping
during times of crisis." She therefore concludes that in our effort to arrive at "the gospel
ideal," "Paul's own cultural upbringing does not establish the pattern for today."15
The implications are shocking for Bible-believers: we are to take these verses of
instruction and counsel in Ephesians 5 not as expression of God's will but of "Paul's own
cultural upbringing." The apostle did not write this under inspiration; he "fell into old patterns
of coping during times of crisis," only "occasionally" glimpsing Christ's ideal. What leads this
writer to think that she understands Christ's "ideal" for the home better than the apostle Paul
did? And when she suggests that "Paul's own cultural upbringing does not establish the
pattern for today," what contemporary pattern is she referring to? Is the "pattern for today"
better than the Bible's role-differentiation that assumes an equal and complementary
relationship between male and female?
Ordaining Women as Elders/Pastors. The discussion of the role of men and women in
ministry also raises the question of cultural conditioning. As one proponent correctly
observed, the issue of women's ordination is "a topic that has shaken the church to its
foundations."16 It has also afforded some scholars the opportunity both to reinterpret early
Seventh-day Adventist history and to domesticate the historical-critical method in the
Adventist church. One evidence of this is the independently published book, The Welcome
Table, a pro-ordination volume widely promoted in some church publications and Adventist
Book Centers.17 For this reason the issue of women's ordination warrants a little more
attention.
A Brief Background. The debate in the church over the ordination of women as
elders/pastors arises because, in the face of calls for it from some quarters today, (1) there is
no biblical precedent in either the Old or New Testament for women being ordained to serve
in the roles of priest, apostle, and elder/pastor;18 and (2) some explicit biblical prohibitions
seem to militate against the practice (1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6; 1 Tim 2:11 ff.; 1 Cor 14:34, 35).19
Areas of Agreement. Both sides of the women's ordination question agree that: (1) Men
and women are equal, equally ceated by God in His image and equally saved by Christ's
precious blood (Gen 1:26, 27; Gal 3:28; 1 Pet 1:19); (2) Both men and women have been
called to soul-winning ministry, to utilize their skills and spiritual gifts (Joel 2:28, 29; 1 Cor
12);20 (3) God has called women to public service in Seventh-day Adventist history as in
Bible times;21 (4) Men and women should receive equal pay for equal work; (5) Ordination is
85
the act of the church in choosing, appointing, and setting apart certain individuals (male and
female) for assigned services through the laying on of hands.22
Points of Disagreement. The issue that divides them is this: "Since both male and female,
through an act of dedication ("the laying on of hands"), can be commissioned to perform
certain specific functions, the debate over women's ordination is not whether women can or
cannot be ordained in this sense; the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy suggest that both men
and women may be commissioned to do certain assigned tasks on behalf of the church. The
key issue to be addressed is whether, among the varied ministries of the church, women may
legitimately be commissioned through ordination to perform the headship functions of elders
or pastors."23 The issue is not ordination per se, but ordination to what function?
In other words, the two sides on the women's ordination question disagree over: (1)
whether the Bible permits women to be "appointed and commissioned" as elders/pastors or
whether the Bible prohibits it; and (2) whether the matter is merely cultural and
administrative and can be settled by vote, or whether it is a biblical and theological issue, on
which God calls us to obedience. The disagreement is not over whether women can serve as
elders/pastors, but whether God permits them to.
The Heart of the Disagreement. Four issues lie at the heart of the disagreement:
(1) The headship principle, which asserts that within the loving relationship of
male-female equality and complementarity, God calls upon men to exercise Christ-like
leadership in both the home and the church. Is this theological principle culturally conditioned
to the days and culture of the Bible writers or is it still valid today?
(2) The relationship between the roles of elder/pastor and prophet: If God can call women
to serve as prophets, what prevents them from serving as elders or pastors?
(3) The position of the early Adventist pioneers on the above two issues: How did the
pioneers understand the headship principle? How did they relate the office of elder/pastor to
that of prophet?
(4) Did the early Adventists ordain women as elders or pastors? Was Ellen G. White
ordained?
1. Biblical Headship. The lack of biblical precedent for ordaining women to the headship
role in the church, combined with the Bible's prohibitions of the practice, raises some
questions. Were the Old Testament writers, Jesus Christ, and Paul male chauvinists? Should
we explain away the male headship role as an accommodation to the Bible writers' culture and
times? If so, how can we account for the fact that at the same time, the Bible also noted the
significant role of women in ministry, including prophesying, praying, teaching, etc.? Could it
be that women's exclusion from the Old Testament priesthood and from the New Testament
roles of apostle and elder/pastor stems not from mere sociological or cultural factors but
rather from God's divine arrangement established at creation?
Those favoring women's ordination argue that the patterns of ordination in the Bible (i.e.,
ordination of males as priests, apostles, and elders/pastors) and the specific biblical
prohibitions (1 Tim 2:11 ff.; 1 Cor 14:34, 35; 1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6) are culturally conditioned
to the Bible writers' time. They argue that the headship principle was introduced after the Fall
and reversed by Christ in His life and work.24 Some maintain that the headship principle is
still valid in the home, but not in the church.
On the other side, those opposing women's ordination maintain that the patterns of
ordination in th Bible confirm the contemporary validity of the headship principle of male
headship and corresponding female cooperation. They argue that God instituted headship at
creation by assigning men and women differing roles; this was reiterated after the Fall.
Christ's work of redemption did not abolish gender-based roles; rather, it ensures that, even in
86
this sinful world, men and women can realize "in the Lord" the true harmony that results from
living in accordance with God's ideal of complementarity.25
Before looking at key hermeneutical questions raised by the headship principle,26 we must
first clarify the relationship between the roles of elder/pastor and prophet. We must also
consider how the Seventh-day Adventist pioneers understood the headship principle and
whether they ordained women (including Ellen G. White) as elders or pastors.
2. Elder/Pastor Not the Same as Prophet. The issue of women exercising the leadership
authority of elders or pastors should not be confused with the legitimacy of women filling the
messenger role of prophets. The role of the prophetic office is not the same as that of the
elected office of elder or pastor. God Himself chooses and authoritatively commissions
(ordains) prophets as His mouthpiece; they are not elected by the people as leaders to exercise
administrative or executive authority. In both the Old and New Testaments, God chose and
commissioned (ordained) prophets without regard to gender (e.g., Miriam, Deborah, Huldah).
On the other hand, the Bible teaches that elders and pastors are to be chosen and
commissioned (ordained) by the church within guidelines stipulated in Scripture. One such
criterion for the office of elder or pastor is that the one chosen must be "the husband of one
wife" (1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6), an expression whose Greek construction emphasizes that the
elder or pastor must be the kind of man who loves only one woman as his wife.27
Elders and pastors (the Bible makes no distinction in their office) are subject to the
authority of God's messages coming through His chosen prophets.28 As leaders of the church,
elders and pastors are given administrative/leadership responsibility and authority that
prophets are not. Church leaders are responsible to God for their reception of the prophetic
message, but they are not under the administrative authority of the prophets.
We may see this difference clearly both in Scripture and in the experience of Ellen G.
White. Elijah could give King Ahab God's message, but he did not have executive authority to
make the king obey or to countermand his orders to have Elijah arrested (1 Kings 17:1-3,
18:7-10). Jeremiah proclaimed God's judgments with divine authority, for which he was
imprisoned by priest, princes, and king (Jer 20:1, 2; 37:11-38:10). They had authority
different from his.
In the early 1870s, Mrs. White had authority to give God's plan for Seventh-day Adventist
education, but she did not have authority to make the leaders follow it in founding Battle
Creek College. Prophetic authority is not the same thing as leadership/administrative
responsibility. She herself refused to be called the leader of the Seventh-day Adventist
church, referring to herself as "a messenger with a message": "No one has ever heard me
claim the position of leader of the denomination. . . . I am not to appear before the people as
holding any other position than that of a messenger with a message" (Testimonies for the
Church, 8:236-237).
3. The Adventist Pioneers and Headship Responsibility. The Seventh-day Adventist
pioneers recognized clearly that while women were prohibited from exercising the headship
role of elder or pastor, Paul's instructions (cf. 1 Tim 2:11 ff.; 1 Cor 14:34) did not preclude
women from the office of prophet. Though some contemporary scholars overlook the above
distinction, our pioneers understood the difference.29
For example, in 1878, an editorial in The Signs of the Times summarized the understanding
of the Adventist pioneers on the headship responsibility of the man in both the home and the
church: "The divine arrangement, even from the beginning, is ths, that the man is the head of
the woman. Every relation is disregarded or abused in this lawless age. But Scriptures always
maintain this order in the family relation. 'For the husband is the head of the wife, even as
Christ is the head of the church.' Eph. 5:23. Man is entitled to certain privileges which are not
given to woman; and he is subjected to some duties and burdens from which the woman is
87
exempt. A woman may pray, prophesy, exhort, and comfort the church, but she cannot
occupy the position of a pastor or a ruling elder. This would be looked upon as usurping
authority over the man, which is here [1 Tim 2:12] prohibited."30
The editorial concluded: "Neither do the words of Paul confine the labors of women to the
act of prophesying alone. He refers to prayers, and also speaks of women who 'labored in the
Lord,' an expression which could only refer to the work of the gospel. He also, in remarking
on the work of prophets, speaks of edification, exhortation, and comfort. This 'labour in the
Lord,' with prayer, comprises all the duties of public worship. Not all the duties of business
meetings, which were probably conducted by men, or all the duties of ruling elders, and
pastors, compare 1 Tim. 5:17, with 2:12, but all that pertain to exercises purely religious. We
sincerely believe that, according to the Scriptures, women, as a right may, and as a duty ought
to, engage in these exercises."31
We must, therefore, summarize the views of the Seventh-day Adventist pioneers.
Recognizing that no part of the Bible is culturally-conditioned, our pioneers clearly
understood that: (1) there is a critical distinction between the authority of prophets and that of
elders or pastors; (2) women have significant roles to play in soul-winning ministry
(including teaching, preaching, etc.):32 and (3) some explicit biblical statements forbid women
to exercise authority over men in the home and the church (1 Tim 2:11-14, 1 Cor 14:34-35;
cf. 1 Tim 3:2, Titus 1:6).33
Based on the above theological positions, our Adventist pioneers did four things: (a) they
accepted the prophetic authority of Ellen G. White; (b) they encouraged women in different
aspects of the work of soul-winning ministry;34 (c) they refused to ordain women as
elders/pastors, even when such a resolution came up for debate at the 1881 General
Conference session;35 (d) they issued ministerial licenses to a number of full-time women
workers of the church, the same as were issued to non-ordained male pastors. These licenses
are to be distinguished from ministerial credentials, the church's highest authorization, given
to its ordained ministers. Ellen G. White, though not ordained, was the only woman known to
have been issued ministerial credentials, apparently because the church had no way to
commission a prophet.36
4. Women as Ordained Elders/Pastors? In early Seventh-day Adventist history women
played major roles in the publishing and editorial work, home missionary work, the work of
Sabbath schools, church finances and administration, frontier missions and evangelism, and
medical and educational work.37 As we noted earlier, those women who labored as full-time
workers were issued the denomination's ministerial license rather than the ministerial
credentials reserved for ordained ministers--indicating that they were not authorized to
perform the distinctive functions of the ordained ministers.
Recently, however, some have mistakenly asserted that because early Adventist women
labored faithfully and successfully in the soul-winning ministry, and because they were issued
ministerial licenses, these women also performed the functions of the ordained ministry. On
this inaccurate assumption, it is often argued that today the "ordination of women to full
gospel ministry is called for by both the historical heritage of the Seventh-day Adventist
Church and by the guidance of God through the ministry of Ellen G. White."38
Contrary to such creative reinterpretation, the Adventist women of the past understood that
while they had been called to do the work of soul-winning, and while it was biblicall
legitimate for them to preach, teach, counsel, minister to the needy, do missionary work, serve
as Bible workers, etc., the Scriptures prohibited them from exercising the headship
responsibility of elder or pastor. These dedicated Adventist women of the past did not view
their non-ordination as a quenching of their spiritual gifts or as an arbitrary restriction on the
countless functions they could perform in gospel ministry. As they labored faithfully within
88
the biblical guidelines of what is appropriate for men and women, the dedicated women of old
discovered the joy in God's ideal for complementary male-female roles in the church.39
It is equally incorrect to suggest that the "guidance of God through the ministry of Ellen G.
White" allows for women's ordination. Contrary to the suggestion in a recent issue of Elder's
Digest, Mrs. White never called for the ordination of women as elders or pastors.40 And as we
already observed, although Ellen G. White was the only woman known to have been issued
Seventh-day Adventist ministerial credentials, she was never ordained.
Mrs. White herself makes it clear that she was never ordained. In 1909, six years before
her death, she personally filled out a "Biographical Information Blank" for the General
Conference records. In response to the request on Item 26, which asks, "If remarried, give
date, and to whom," she wrote an "X," indicating that she had never remarried. Earlier, Item
19 had asked, "If ordained, state when, where, and by whom." Here she also wrote an "X,"
meaning that she had never been ordained. She was not denying that God had chosen her and
commissioned her as a prophet, but she was responding to the obvious intent of the question,
indicating that there had never been an ordination ceremony carried out for her.41
During her later years, Mrs. White was known mostly as "Sister White" and affectionately
as "Mother White." She was never known as "Elder White" or "Pastor Ellen." Every church
member knew that "Elder White" was either her husband, James, or her son, W. C. White.42
Thus, for more than 100 years the Adventist position on the ordained ministry claimed the
support of Scripture, as expressed in the teaching and practice of the Adventist pioneers,
including Ellen G. White. By the 1970s, however, this established position began to be
reversed in favor of ordaining women as elders and pastors, a situation that has created a
theological and ecclesiological dilemma for Seventh-day Adventists.
5. Our Contemporary Dilemma. The major impetus for redefining the Adventist
understanding and practice of ministry (and hence, for women's ordination) was the desire by
church administrators to permit full-time non-ordained gospel workers (i.e. men and women
holding ministerial licenses) in the United States to enjoy tax benefits reserved by their
government for those "invested with the status and authority of an ordained minister."
Whereas Adventists historically have insisted that their practice must always be brought into
line with the inspired Word, on the issue of women's ordination it was the reverse.
Tax-benefit considerations provided the critical motivation for the church to effect a series of
Annual Council policy revisions and Church Manual alterations, allowing for a change in the
church's long-standing policy regarding the ministry of ordained elders and pastors.43
Having thus allowed tax considerations to redefine the Adventist theology of ordination,
the church has since faced this dilemma: (1) Should the church humbly admit that it was
wrong in allowing financial interests to dictate its theology and proceed courageously to
rescind previous church council actions so as to return to the biblical practice long maintained
by the Adventist pioneers? or (2) Should the church insist that there is "no turning back" on
the tax-benefit redefinition of its ordination theology and, on that assumption, continue to
seek creative ways to reinterpret biblical passages that the Adventist pioneers understood as
prohibiting women from serving in the headship roles of elders and pastors? These two
options comprise the church's hermeneutical dilemma.4
Among those urging the second option are the advocates of the historical-critical method.
For example, using higher-critical assumptions, some of the essays in the pro-ordination
book, The Welcome Table, seek to reinterpret the crucial biblical passages (e.g., 1 Tim
2:11ff.; 1 Cor 14:34-35; 1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6) by arguing that they are culturally conditioned
to the times of the Bible writers. Before looking at the hermeneutical issues raised by these
recent reinterpretations, we must state two important conclusions from our brief background
discussion in the preceding pages.
89
Summary. While tax considerations provided the crucial motivation to redefine our
practice and theology of ordination, the Scriptures and the long history of Adventist
understanding and practice stood in the way of this redefinition. However, the agenda of some
proponents of women's ordination intersected with the desire of church leaders to solve their
tax problems when higher-critical scholars offered a welcome ideological method for
reinterpreting the Scriptures. In this way they attempted to bring the Bible into harmony with
the revised theology of ordination.
In short, the present agitation to ordain women as pastors and to issue them ministerial
credentials is a departure from the long-standing Adventist understanding and practice. More
significantly, ordaining women as elders or pastors also raises some critical questions about
biblical interpretation.
Key Hermeneutical Questions. The following questions beg for biblically consistent
answers: Is the requirement that an elder or pastor be a male (1 Tim 3:2; Titus 3:2) culturally
conditioned? Also, when Paul wrote that women are to "keep silence in the churches; for it is
not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also
saith the law. . ." (1 Cor 14:34-35), are we to interpret the prohibition as Paul's "opinion," the
command as Paul's personal "suggestion," and the law as the imposition of some "Jewish law"
upon the Corinthian church as well as upon believers "in the churches" (including non-Jewish
churches)? This is the position of one Adventist scholar.45
Further, if the "law" referred to in 1 Corinthians 14:34 is not a "Jewish law," or even a
"Corinthian law," but is a reference to the Old Testament Scriptures, as the use of the word
"law" in verse 21 suggests, did Paul concoct an Old Testament justification to put women
down? In the two texts that seem to link the headship role of elder/pastor to gender (1 Cor
14:34-35 and 1 Tim 2:11-14), did the apostle use a rabbinic, or even distorted, logic in an
effort to make his point? That is, did Paul use the Old Testament wrongly in advancing his
argument? How do we know? Can today's uninspired interpreters claim to understand the Old
Testament better than the inspired Bible writers did? Was Paul forced to compromise the
ethical ideal of "equality" (redefined as obliterating gender role differentiation) when he
apparently taught role differences between male and female? And were his views merely an
adaptation to the cultural beliefs, mores, and practices of people he wanted to win?
The answers implied in the above hermeneutical questions expose the higher-critical
assumptions of some proponents of women's ordination.
Was Paul Inconsistent? For example, in his attempt to address some of the key questions
above, one Adventist professor of ethics intimates that Paul "violated" ethical principle in 1
Corinthians 14:34 and 1 Timothy 2:11, 12: "Paul appears to violate this [ethical] principle on
two occasions by making gender, not gifts the determining factor" for women aspiring to be
elders/pastors. He explains that given the time in which the apostle lived, these ethical
concessions can be excused: "Paul made as few ethical concessions to current practice as
possible, and as many as necessary. If he were alive today, he would not ask us to reiterate
everything he did in his time. He would ask us to travel as far and as fast as possible in the
direction he was moving in the hope that in our time we will move closer to the full recovery
of equal partnership between Manand Woman than he could in his."46
What the above writer fails to address is why Paul presents his alleged inconsistent ethical
conduct as a command to be followed by believers in "all the churches" (1 Cor 14:34) and as
"a command of the Lord" (14:37).
Was Paul's Teaching Culturally Conditioned? A former associate editor of a church
publication takes up this issue in discussing 1 Corinthians 14:34, 35 ("Let your women keep
silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to
90
be under obedience, as also saith the law . . .), and on 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 ("To the Jews I
became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. . . . To those outside the law I became as one outside
the law . . . that I might win those outside the law").
According to this Adventist editor, these texts indicate that Paul accommodated his
teaching and lifestyle to his culture. What he fails to address is whether Paul compromised the
truth by "accommodating" to culture--the crucial question distinguishing proponents of the
historical-critical method from Bible-believing Adventists.
He explains Paul's "seemingly inconsistent conduct under varying cultural circumstances"
in this manner: "Beyond any question, Paul's personal conduct [1 Cor 9] and his counsel [1
Cor 14] as a representative of Jesus Christ were both culturally conditioned to the
circumstances in which he found himself and to which he addressed his teaching. The
important thing--the principle involved--was an adaptation of his own lifestyle and his
directives to the culture-conditioned beliefs, mores, and practices of the people he aspired to
win to Christ."47
Some may wonder whether indeed this author's opinion is "beyond any question." Our
concern, however, is how he arrived at "the principle involved" in Paul's "seemingly
inconsistent conduct under varying cultural circumstances."
Did Paul Err? Another question deserves a response: Did Paul err in his understanding
and interpretation of the Old Testament? Aside from the contentious issue of what is involved
in Paul's prohibition of women to "teach and have authority over man," when the apostle
forbids such "teaching and authority" to a woman on the grounds that "Adam was first
formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman . . ." (1 Tim 2:11-14), can we
dismiss this statement as culturally conditioned to Paul's time?48 Can the Christian accept the
suggestion by some that Paul's argument--which is not cultural but theological, grounded in
Creation and the Fall--is not God's logic but Paul's? Is it merely an example of the rabbinic
midrash that was in vogue in his day?49
Refuting Gnostic (Feminist) Heresy? A retired professor of religion voices the same
"culturally-conditioned" argument. He bases his argument upon the questionable work of a
non-Adventist scholar who theorizes that in 1 Timothy 2 Paul was responding to a Gnostic
heresy in Ephesus, which held that woman (not man) was created first and that man (not
woman) was deceived. This hypothetical, syncretistic theology allegedly encouraged women
to domineer over men in public church meetings. On this fanciful speculation, our own
professor suggests that the apostle's teaching regarding male-female relationships is culturally
conditioned to the local situation in Ephesus. Therefore, he claims, it may not have validity
today: "The passage does not give a universal prohibition of women from the ministry, but
instead is a refutation of Gnostic error."50
The crucial hermeneutical question is not addressed: Was Paul inspired when he
apparently saw the male-female relationship established at creation before the fall ("Adam
was formed first"), and confirmed after the fall (Eve "being deceived . . .")? Should we accept
the suggestion that an alleged Gnostic heresy is the basis for Paul's statement rather than the
Old Testament account of the creation and fall as Paul himself maintains? How can Adventist
scholars continue to recycle the discredited Gnostic hypothesis when it has been shown
convincingly to be founded on disputable assumptions and questionable inferences?51
In view of the ideological dogmatism and fanciful speculations attending the interpretation
of 1 Timothy 2, Adventists desiring to speak knowledgeably on 1 Timothy 2:11ff. will benefit
greatly from consulting the excellent review of the arguments and literature in the recent book
Women in the Church: A Fresh Analysis of 1 Timothy 2:9-15.52
Summary. After all the flamboyant hermeneutical phrases are stripped away, and after all
the high-sounding but superficial references to "ethical principles" ("equality," "justice," and
91
"fairness") are examined in the light of biblical testimony, the hermeneutical questions
concerning 1 Corinthians 14:34-35 and 1 Timothy 2:11-14 still remain: Should today's
interpreters accept Paul as an inspired and trustworthy writer of Scripture, or not? Shall we
accuse the apostle of faulty logic, midrashic or rabbinic interpretation, adapting his lifestyle to
his culturally-conditioned beliefs, mores, and practices, and violating ethical principle (the
best he could do under those circumstances)? Are his statements inspired commands, or are
they merely expressions of uninspired personal opinions--opinions that reflect his culture and
hence do not apply to us?
Some even argue that in these texts bearing on male-female role differences, "God
constantly adapts to sinful human conditions," or that the "specific passages [were] addressed
to specific cultural situations."53 How can a "command of the Lord," addressed to "all the
churches," referred to as "the law," and grounded in the fact of "creation," be a sinful
practice and hence culturally conditioned?
In short, certain significant Bible passages (like Eph 5:22-33; Col 3:18-19; 1 Pet 3:1-7; 1
Cor 11:3, 11-12; 14:34-35; 1 Tim 2:11-14; 3:2; and Titus 1:6) seem clearly to teach that
within the loving relationship of male-female equality and complementarity, the man has been
called upon to be head of the home and the church. Can Bible-believing Christians accept the
assertion that these passages do not apply to us today? Shall we reject them because we claim
that (1) they reflect God's adaptation to sinful situations in the Greco-Roman world or (2)
even if they are not accommodations to sinful situations, they are only for the times in which
they were uttered?
Inspiration and Relevance of Ellen G. White's Writings. But just as historical-critical
assumptions influence scholars' treatment of the inspired writers of the Bible, so also do these
assumptions shape views on Ellen White's writings. To diminish the binding authority of the
Spirit of Prophecy, some apply the cultural-conditioning argument to the Spirit of Prophecy.
"Massive Re-Education." Thus, a former college president, now a professor of English in
an Adventist university, has urged the church to "take a serious look at the entire issue of
Ellen White's inspiration. As a church we have never yet formed a definitive position relative
to revelation found in her writings as differentiated from her devotional messages." Such a
course, he explains, "would require massive re-education of church leadership, church
ministry, and laity." Adopting this suggestion, he concludes, "would force us to say that The
Great Controversy, including specific teaching relative to last-day events, represents the
conviction of its author, who might have written otherwise today. Such a position would
seriously trouble those who have been conditioned to believe that while Ellen White's
writings may be a lesser light than the Bible, they are all still sacred in a revelational way."54
Is such a "massive re-education of church leadership, church ministry, and laity"
underway? Today we hear increasingly that the message of Ellen White was conditioned by
her "Victorian culture." Consequently, we are told, we can no longer take all her writings
seriously; they are good as "devotional messages," but we cannot take all her writings "in a
revelational way." When the author states that "revelation [is] found in her writings," he is
actually saying what others say about all inspired writings--the Bible or Spirit of
Prophecy--namely, we cannot take everything as inspired. Some things in Scripture an the
Spirit of Prophecy are not inspired. Since some portions are inspired and others are not, we
need the enlightened scholar's "massive re-education" to know how to pick and choose the
inspired writings. The Bible is not an inspired Book; rather it is an inspiring booklet. Pick
your favorite parts, cafeteria style.55
New Views of the Spirit of Prophecy. To help in the "massive re-education" concerning
the writings of Ellen White, a chaplain and teacher at an Adventist university who holds a
92
"dynamic," "developmental," and "Christ-centered view of inspiration"56 has proposed
re-conceptualizing the Adventist understanding of the Spirit of Prophecy: "Ellen White must
be seen as a uniquely gifted woman who used the talents she was given to God's glory, just as
other women in the church may do with their respective gifts if they are properly recognized.
The church has traditionally set her too far apart from other women, and all other human
beings for that matter, by claiming too much for her, and by claiming too much for what the
gift of prophecy entails."57
Does this mean that all individuals who fully employ their "gifts" and "talents" to the glory
of God have the gift of prophecy? Is that the sense in which we are to understand the
prophetic ministry of Ellen White?
According to the above author, "Adventists, who accept Ellen White as a post-Biblical
prophet, would also recognise the prophetic ministry of individuals such as Joan of Arc,
Martin Luther, John Wesley, Martin Luther King [Jr.], Desmond Tutu, etc. These individuals
have not only issued radical calls for repentance and justice, but more importantly from a
Christian perspective have pointed humanity back to Jesus Christ as the only perfect source of
truth."58 A former book editor of one of the church's publishing houses made this point
explicit: "Beyond her [Ellen White's] visions, I have no reason to believe she was more of a
prophet than Martin Luther or Mother Theresa. But I do have reason to believe she was a
prophet nonetheless. And a mighty one at that. . . . Why do I believe she was a prophet? For
one thing, she was a mystic, and I think people who enjoy a direct, unmediated connection to
God are prophets prima facie."59
Notice the implication. If Ellen White's "prophetic ministry" is little or no different from
that of Martin Luther, Mother Theresa, and "all other human beings for that matter," it stands
to reason that we must treat her writings in much the same way as we do other human books.
Her writings are "inspired" in the sense that they are inspiring--or if at all uniquely "inspired,"
they are not fully inspired.
Also, since Ellen White is compared to the biblical prophets, it stands to reason that their
writings also will not be fully inspired; some things in them are inspired and others are
culturally conditioned by the limitations and mistakes of their times: "The writings of Ellen
White contain historical, scientific, medical, theological and other informational errors, which
reflect the misconceptions that existed in her day. Her writings fit well with the thinking of
her age, and did not contain significant ideas which were unheard of at that time."60
Summary. Let us briefly summarize the new understanding of the "prophetic ministry" of
Ellen White, and for that matter our own gifts of prophecy. Prophetic ministry is using one's
unique gifts and talents to their highest potential, having vision (as opposed to visions) and
courage to address the important issues of one's day. In the case of Ellen White, it meant that
she made "mistakes" and "misquoted and misinterpreted scripture (also as did Bible
writers)."61 Later in this chapter, we shall point out the implications of this new view of Ellen
White's writings. Right now, however, we should only note that this understanding of the
nature of inspired writings stems from higher-critical assumptions which many scholars have
embraced.
In fact, the Adventist university chaplain cited earlier states that the new view of
inspiration is the result of "a broader understanding of the nature of inspiration that has come
through Adventism's exposure to higher educaion, and the application of the historical-critical
method to both Scripture and the writings of Ellen White."62
A Bible-Believing Adventist Response
As we have noted earlier, many of the "culturally conditioned" arguments are based on the
93
myth of evolutionism which maintains that the inspired writers were "primitive" or even
"barbarians." Roland M. Frye's response to this chronological snobbery is apt: "The barbarian
blindly asserts the primacy of his own temporal and cultural provincialism in judging and
understanding and interpreting all that occurs, and the learned barbarian does precisely the
same thing, but adds footnotes."63
The Bible Writers' View. Peter provided the best response to the "culturally-conditioned"
argument: "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Pet 1:20-21).
The oft-made suggestion that Paul's statements on such issues as Christian dress, sexual
role differentiation, and homosexuality (1 Tim 2:9-14; 1 Cor 14:34-35; 11:3, 8-12; Rom
1:21-32) are "culturally conditioned" flies in the face of his own protest: "For this I was
appointed a preacher and apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the
Gentiles in faith and truth" (1 Tim 2:7, emphasis supplied).64 The Bible does not teach that
some parts of Scripture are not inspired, while others are. Who decides which portions of
Scripture are inspired and which are not?
The apostle Paul adamantly insists that his messages were not tainted by faulty logic of
human wisdom or words distorted by the culture of their times. Instead, the Spirit who
revealed the message to the Bible writers also enabled them to communicate it accurately:
"When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I
proclaimed to you the testimony about God. . . . My message and my preaching were not with
wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power, so that your faith
might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power. . . . This is what we speak, not in words
taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in
spiritual words" (1 Cor 2:1, 3, 13 NIV).
Those who are tempted to fault the Bible writers' logic and understanding of spiritual
truths, dismissing their teachings as culturally conditioned, need to be reminded of Paul's
statement: "The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are
spiritually discerned" (1 Cor 2:14 NIV).
Ellen White's Position. Ellen White rejected the "culturally-conditioned" argument of
modern scholars. She asserted that the Holy Spirit guided the Bible writers to record their
accounts with such an "exact fidelity" that the Holy Scriptures are to be deemed as "truthful
history of the human race, one that is unmarred by human prejudice or human pride"
(Testimonies for the Church, 4:370; Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 84-85; cf.
Education, p. 173). Though uninspired historians are so partial that they are unable to record
history without their biases, the inspired writers "did not testify to falsehoods to prevent the
pages of sacred history being clouded by the record of human frailties and faults. The scribes
of God wrote as they were dictated by the Holy Spirit, having no control of the work
themselves. They penned the literal truth, ad stern, forbidding facts are revealed for reasons
that our finite minds cannot fully comprehend" (Testimonies for the Church, 4:9-10).65
The Question of the Human and Divine. Besides the questionable
"culturally-conditioned" argument, some also attempt to separate the human and divine
elements in Scripture and classify some parts (the so-called human portions) as not fully
inspired. But arguing that to be human necessarily means to be sinful and thus to err and to
make mistakes is wrong biblically. "Human nature does not per se include sin. If that were the
94
case, Jesus Christ who was the 'second Adam,' the real Man, who was truly human should
have sinned. But according to Scripture, Jesus never sinned . . . (Heb 4:15). Thus a true
Incarnational model of the Bible reflects that the Bible is indeed the Word of God, it is indeed
exactly as Christ is, truly divine and truly human, and both together form an inseparable
unity. The Bible is not mistaken in what it tells us as He was not mistaken in what He told us.
It is fully trustworthy in what it says--it is without 'sin' to use the analogical term. In the same
way that Jesus did not sin intentionally nor unintentionally Scripture does not give wrong
information--intentionally or unintentionally."66
Ellen White challenged the tendency of some scholars to separate the human and divine
elements in Scripture, conferring uninspired or fallible status upon some portions of the
written Word. "The union of the divine and the human, manifest in Christ, exists also in the
Bible. . . . And this fact, so far from being an argument against the Bible, should strengthen
faith in it as the word of God. Those who pronounce upon the inspiration of the Scriptures,
accepting some portions as divine while they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact
that Christ, the divine, partook of our human nature, that He might reach humanity. In the
work of God for man's redemption, divinity and humanity are combined" (Testimonies for the
Church, 5:747; cf. The Great Controversy, p. vi).67
Bible-believing Adventists recognize the impossibility of separating what is divine from
what is human in Scripture. They also recognize that attempting to do so denies the basic
unity of Scripture. Against this liberal view, they assert that the Bible is ultimately the product
of one divine mind, the Holy Spirit; hence, a theological unity runs through the Bible from
Genesis to Revelation. This unity means that we may compare Scripture with Scripture to
arrive at correct doctrine. It makes the later inspired writers the best interpreters of earlier
inspired writers.
A Warning. Because the entire Scripture is inspired, Ellen White warned: "Do not let any
living man come to you and begin to dissect God's Word, telling what is revelation, what is
inspiration and what is not, without a rebuke. . . . We call on you to take your Bible, but do
not put a sacrilegious hand upon it, and say, 'That is not inspired,' simply because somebody
else has said so. Not a jot or tittle is ever to be taken from that Word. Hands off, brethren! Do
not touch the ark. . . . When men begin to meddle with God's Word, I want to tell them to take
their hands off, for they do not know what they are doing" (Seventh-day Adventist Bible
Commentary, 7:919-920). Again she wrote: "Brethren, cling to your Bible, as it reads, and
stop your criticisms in regard to its validity, and obey the Word, and not one of you will be
lost" (Selected Messages, 1:18).
NOTES
1. Besides dreams and visions, methods of revelation include: direct [theophanic]
revelation(Ex 3:1-4:23; 20; 1 Kings 19:9-18; Rev 1:11-3:22), historical research (Luke 1:1-4),
memory (John 14:26), and the use of the Bible writers' own judgment (1 Cor 7:12). All these
are consistent with God's ways, since He Himself can choose to lead the inspired writers to
discover the truths He has already revealed in nature, history and human experience (Ps 19;
Rom 1, 2; Heb 1:1-2). It was the Spirit of God who illumined the natural faculties of Bible
writers to present messages that have been kept for our benefit in such books as Job,
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Luke, Acts, etc. Even references to uninspired pagan philosophers
(e.g., Acts 17:22-28), as well as the "fights" and moral failures or shortcomings of Bible
writers have all been recorded for our learning (see Acts 15; Jonah; Gal 2:11-14; Matt
16:21-23). Some of the Bible records also include things dealing with common or personal
95
aspects of life. For example, 2 Timothy 4:13 talks about Paul's "pedestrian" request to
Timothy to bring along his winter coat and books.

18. The Bible teaches that, despite their significant role in ministry, women in Old
Testament times were not ordained as priests. Also, though they made major contributions to
the ministry of Christ, He did not appoint a single one of them as an apostle; further, when a
replacement apostle was sought (Acts 1:15-26), even though women were present and surely
met most of the requirements set (vv. 21-22), it was a male who was chosen. In addition, we
have no record of any woman's being ordained as an elder or pastor in the New Testament
church. Why was this so?
19. Despite the active involvement of women in ministry in the apostolic church, Paul's
pastoral epistles to Timothy and Titus (letters specifically written to pastors and laity) contain
instruction that only men may aspire to the office of elder or pastor. "I permit no woman to
teach or to have authority over men" (1 Tim 2:12; cf. 1 Cor 14:34, 35); "a bishop [or elder]
must be . . . the husband of one wife" (1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6). These passages all use the same
Greek word for "man" and "husband." It is not the generic term anthropos, from which the
English word "anthropology" derives and which refers to human beings, male or female,
without regard to gender. Rather, Paul employed the specific word aner, a term that means a
male person in distinction from a woman (cf. Acts 8:12; 1 Tim 2:12), one capable of being a
husband (see Matt 1:16; John 4:16; Rom 7:2; Titus 1:6). Why did Paul prohibit women from
exercising the headship/leadership role of elder or pastor?
20. The Bible clearly teaches that women have been called to the work of soul-winning
ministry as surely as have men. In the Old Testament, women participated in the study and
teaching of the law (Neh 8:2; Prov 1:8; Deut 13:6-11), in offering prayers and vows to God (1
Sam 1:10; Num 30:9; Gen 25:22; 30:6, 22; 2 Kings 4:9-10, 20-37), in ministering "at the
entrance to the tent of meeting" (1 Sam 2:22), in singing at the worship of the temple service
(Ezra 2:65), and in engaging in the prophetic ministry of exhortation and guidance (Ex 15:20;
2 Kings 22:14-20; 2 Chron 34:22-28; Judges 4:4-14). Of this latter group, especially
prominent are Deborah, "a prophetess . . . [who] was judging [NIV "leading"] Israel at that
time" (Judges 4:4), and Huldah, the prophetess to whom Josiah the king and Hilkiah the high
priest looked for spiritual guidance (2 Kings 22).
The New Testament portrays women fulfilling vital roles in ministry. Besides Mary
and Martha, a number of other women, including Joanna and Susanna, supported Jesus with
their own means (Luke 8:2-3). Tabitha ministered to the needy (Acts 9:36). Other women,
including Lydia, Phoebe, Lois, and Eunice, distinguished themselves in fulfilling the mission
of the church (Acts 16:14-15; 21:8-9; Rom 16:1-4, 12). Of these, many were Paul's
co-workers in ministry. Priscilla apparently was well educated and an apt instructor in the
new faith (Rom 16:3; Acts 18:26); Paul calls Phoebe "a servant of the church" and a
"succourer of many, and of myself also" (Rom 16:1, 2); Mary, Tryphena, Tryposa, and Persis
ll "worked very hard in the Lord" (Rom 16:6, 12); Euodia and Syntyche were women "who
have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel" (Phil 4:3 RSV); and Junia, who suffered
imprisonment with Paul, received commendation as someone "of note among the apostles"
(Rom 16:7).
21. Ellen G. White strongly encouraged women in ministry. "There are women who
should labor in the gospel ministry. In many respects they would do more good than the
ministers who neglect to visit the flock of God" (Evangelism, p. 472). "The Lord has a work
97
for women as well as for men. . . . The Saviour will reflect upon these self-sacrificing women
the light of His countenance, and will give them a power that exceeds that of men. They can
do in families a work that men cannot do, a work that reaches the inner life. They can come
close to the hearts of those whom men cannot reach. Their labor is needed" (ibid., pp.
464-465, emphasis added). Seventh-day Adventist history and current practice illustrate the
biblical truth that indeed women have a role in ministry.
22. Several Greek words in the New Testament are translated "ordain" (KJV); they
convey such meanings as to "choose," "appoint," or "set apart." For example, Jesus "ordained
(poieo) twelve" (Mark 3:14); Paul himself was "ordained (tithemi) a preacher and an apostle"
(1 Tim 2:7; cf., 4:14; 5:22); Titus was urged to "ordain (kathistemi) elders in every city"
(Titus 1:5). Each of these three Greek words carries the sense of "appoint," "place," or
"establish." Another word used in the New Testament for the act of ordination is cheirotoneo,
which can mean "to stretch forth the hand," or "elect" or "appoint." Thus Paul and Barnabas
"ordained them elders in every church" (Acts 14:23); and when Titus was appointed by the
churches to travel with Paul to Jerusalem, we are told that he was "chosen of the churches" (2
Cor 8:19). The compound form of the word, procheirotoneo, appears in Acts 10:41, where it
describes God's prior appointment of the apostles. Thus, ordination is the act of the church in
choosing, appointing, and setting apart through the laying on of hands certain individuals to
perform specific functions on behalf of the church (cf. The Acts of the Apostles, p. 161).
Rightly understood, both male and female can be ordained to do some assigned tasks (i.e.,
both male and female, through an act of dedication, can be commissioned to do specific
assigned tasks; cf. Ellen G. White, The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, July, 9, 1895, p.
434). The question is whether those tasks include the headship role of elder/pastor. For more
on this, see our Searching the Scriptures, (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Adventists Affirm, 1995),
pp. 21-23; cf. ibid., p. 24 note 6.

Adventists Affirm 10/1 (Spring 1996):49.
25. Koranteng-Pipim, Searching the Scriptures, pp. 45-55. Based on an analysis of the
biblical data, we have concluded: "Thus, with respect to the attempt to ordain women, just as
with the bid to change the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday, we respond that the testimonies
of Scripture indicate that God the Father did not do it; the Old Testament is clear that the
patriarchs, prophets and kings never did do it; the gospels reveal that Jesus, the Desire of
Ages, would not do it; the epistles and the acts of the apostles declare that the commissioned
apostles could not do it; Ellen White, with a prophetic vision of the great controversy between
Christ and Satan, dared not do it. Should we who live at the turn of another millennium do
it?" (ibid., p. 65).

Ordination of Women: Methodological Reflections on Key Passages," May 23, 1994,

27. The Greek phrase, mias [of one] gunaikos [woman] andra [man], literally translates as
a "man of one woman," or "one-woman-man," meaning "a male of one woman." When used
of the marriage relation, it may be translated "husband of one wife" (KJV) or "husband of but
one wife" (NIV). Because in this passage the words for "man" and "woman" do not have the
definite article, the construction in the Greek emphasizes character or nature. Thus, "one can
translate, 'one-wife sort of a husband,' or 'a one-woman sort of a man.' . . . Since character is
emphasized by the Greek construction, the bishop should be a man who loves only one
98
woman as his wife" (see Kenneth S. Wuest, The Pastoral Epistles in the Greek New
Testament for the English Reader [Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1952], p. 53). Also,
because the word "one" (mias) is positioned at the beginning of the phrase in the Greek, it
appears to emphasize the monogamous nature of this relationship. Thus, the phrase "husband
of one wife" is calling for monogamous fidelity--that is to say, an elder must be "faithful to his
one wife" (NEB). For an excellent summary of the various interpretations of this text, see
Ronald A. G. du Preez, Polygamy in the Bible with Implications for Seventh-day Adventist
Missiology (D.Min. project dissertation, Andrews University, 1993), pp. 266-277.

ordination some have misunderstood the crucial distinction between the prophetic office and
that of pastor/elder. See, for example, George R. Knight's, "Proving More Than Intended,"

33. We have dealt with this in greater detail in Searching the Scriptures (Berrien Springs,
Mich.: Adventists Affirm, 1995). The following two paragraphs are from p. 30 of that work,
reproduced here without their supporting endnotes:
When the Bible urges women to "keep silence" in church (1 Cor 14:34), it does not
mean that women cannot pray, prophesy, preach, evangelize or teach in the church. In the
same letter to the Corinthians in which Paul told women to keep silence in the church, he
indicated that women may pray and prophesy, provided they are dressed appropriately (1 Cor
11:2-16). And he said that the one who prophesies speaks "edification, and exhortation, and
comfort" (14:3). Also, just like the command in the same chapter that those who speak in
tongues should "keep silence in the church" if no interprete was present (1 Cor 14:28), the
instruction that women should "keep silence in the churches" suggests that Paul wants women
to exercise their gift to speak within certain appropriate guidelines. Further, the same Paul
who urged women "to learn in silence" (1 Tim 2:11) and who did not permit women to "teach
or to have authority over men" (1 Tim 2:12 RSV) apparently approved the "teaching"
ministry of Priscilla and Aquila in their instruction of Apollos (Acts 18:26). Paul also
required women to do a certain kind of teaching: "Bid the older women . . . to teach what is
good, and so train the young women to love their husbands and children" (Titus 2:3-5 RSV).
These texts should alert the Bible student that the prohibition of women "to
99
teach or to have authority over men" does not forbid to women every form of teaching. Unlike
other terms used in the New Testament to communicate the idea of teaching, the Greek word
didasko used in this passage carries the force of authoritative teaching entrusted to a
person--particularly someone in the leadership role in the church (cf. 1 Tim 3:2; 4:11; 6:2; 2
Tim 2:2). In light of the wider context of Paul's pastoral epistles to Timothy and Titus, as well
as the immediate context which links this form of teaching with exercising "authority over
men," we may conclude that Paul is here prohibiting women from the kind of teaching done
in the capacity of a leader of the church. In other words, the apostle Paul is not forbidding all
teaching to women, but only the kind of "teaching" in the church which gives women a
position of authority over men.

Church," in A Woman's Place: Seventh-day Adventist Women in Church and Society, ed. Rosa
T. Banks (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald Publishing Assn., 1992), pp. 41-74; Laurel
Damsteegt, "S. M. I. Henry: Pioneer in Women's Ministry," Adventists Affirm 9/1 (Spring
1995):17-19, 46. The spirit of the early Adventist women is also reflected in the soul-winning
ministries of women in Africa and many other parts of the world. See, for example, J. J.
Nortey, "The Bible, Our Surest Guide," Adventists Affirm 9/2 (Spring 1995):47-49, 67; cf.
Terri Saelee, "Women of the Spirit," Adventists Affirm 9/2 (Fall 1995):60-63. But contrary to
revisionist interpretations of Adventist history, none of these roles required women to be
ordained as elders or pastors (see William Fagal, "Ellen White and the Role of Women in the
Church," available from the Ellen G. White Estate, and adapted as chapter 10 in Samuele
Bacchiocchi's Women in the Church (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Biblical Perspectives, 1987); a
summary version of Fagal's work is found in his "Did Ellen White Call for Ordaining
Women?" Ministry, December 1988, pp. 8-11, and "Did Ellen White Support the Ordination
of Women?" Ministry, February 1989, pp. 6-9; cf., Samuel Koranteng-Pipim, Searching the
Scriptures, pp. 70-83, where we discuss "Restless Eves" and "Reckless Adams."
35. The 1881 General Conference session considered a resolution to permit ordaining
women to the gospel ministry (Review and Herald, Dec. 20, 1881, p. 392). The minutes
clearly show that instead of approving the resolution (as some today have erroneously
claimed), the delegates referred it to the General Conference committee. There it died; neither
Ellen G. White nor the other pioneers brought it up again. The issue did not resurface until
recent decades. See the work of William Fagal, referenced in the previous note.
36. A number of dedicated women who worked for the church in the late 1800's and early
1900's were issued ministerial licenses. Ellen White was issued ministerial credentials from
1871 until her death in 1915. Three of her ministerial credential certificates--dated 1883,
1885, and 1887--are still in the possession of the Ellen G. White Estate.
It is interesting to note that on one of them (1885) the word "ordained" is neatly
crossed out, but on the other two certificates it is not. Does this mean that Ellen White was
"ordained" in 1883, "unordained" in 1885, and "re-ordained" in 1887? Obviously not. Rater,
the crossing out of "ordained" in 1885 highlights the awkwardness of giving credentials to a
prophet. No such special category of credentials from the church exists. So the church utilized
what it had, giving its highest credentials without an ordination ceremony having been carried
out. In actuality, the prophet needed no human credentials. She functioned for more than
twenty-five years (prior to 1871) without any.
For more on this, see William Fagal's "Was Ellen White Ordained?" in his "Ellen
White and the Role of Women in the Church," available from the Ellen G. White Estate. This
paper was adapted for two published articles: "Did Ellen White Call for Ordaining Women?"

38. Bert Haloviak, "The Adventist Heritage Calls for Ordination of Women," Spectrum
16/3 (August 1985):52. More examples of such revisionist interpretation of Seventh-day
Adventist history can be found in some pro-ordination works, which leave readers with the
false impression that the issuance of ministerial licenses to dedicated Adventist women of the
past implied that they labored as ordained ministers. See, for example, Josephine Benton,
Called by God: Stories of Seventh-day Adventist Women Ministers (Smithsburg, Md.:
Blackberry Hill Publishers, 1990). Cf. the following articles in The Welcome Table: Bert
Haloviak, "A Place at the Table: Women and the Early Years," pp. 27-44; idem, "Ellen G.
White Statements Regarding Ministry," pp. 301-308; and Kitt Watts, "Moving Away from the
Table: A Survey of Historical Factors Affecting Women Leaders," pp. 45-59; cf. "Selected
List of 150 Adventist Women in Ministry, 1844-1994," Appendix 6.
While in early Adventist records, full-time workers carrying ordained ministers'
credentials were listed as "Ministers," for un-ordained workers (women and some men) with
ministerial licenses, the term "Licentiates" was used. In later Yearbooks of the church, the
terms "Ordained Ministers" and "Licensed Ministers" were employed for these two categories
of church workers. Both the early and later distinctions between the two groups of full-time
workers ensured that under no circumstance could unordained laborers in the soul-winning
ministry be confused with ordained ministers. There is, therefore, no valid justification for
some contemporary writers to suggest or create the impression that women listed as "licensed
ministers" performed the functions of ordained ministers, or that women today seeking to do
full-time work in the gospel ministry must be ordained as elders/pastors. The facts from the
"historical heritage of the Seventh-day Adventist Church" do not support such a conclusion.
39. For a helpful corrective to the historical revisionism of some contemporary writers on
the issue of ordination (see note 38 above), refer to the careful work by William Fagal "Ellen
White and the Role of Women in the Church," available from the Ellen G. White Estate; a
summary version of Fagal's work is found in his "Did Ellen White Call for Ordaining
Women? Ministry, December 1988, pp. 8-11; "Did Ellen White Support the Ordination of
Women? Ministry, February 1989, pp. 6-9; cf. Samuel Koranteng-Pipim, Searching the
Scriptures, pp. 70-83, where we discuss "Restless Eves" and "Reckless Adams."
40. Rose Otis, "Ministering to the Whole Church," Elder's Digest, Number Nine, p. 15.
Elder's Digest is published by the General Conference Ministerial Association. As in this
article, one statement from Ellen White has often been taken out of context and misused to
claim support for ordaining women as elders or pastors: "Women who are willing to
consecrate some of their time to the service of the Lord should be appointed to visit the sick,
look after the young, and minister to the necessities of the poor. They should be set apart to
this work by prayer and laying on of hands. In some cases they will need to counsel with the
church officers or the minister; but if they are devoted women, maintaining a vital connection
with God, theywill be a power for good in the church" (Ellen G. White, The Advent Review
and Sabbath Herald, July 9, 1895, p. 434, emphasis supplied).
Evidence that this statement may not be applied to ordination of women as pastors or
elders may be found within the passage itself. (1) This is a part-time ministry, not a calling to
a lifework. "Women who are willing to consecrate some of their time . . . ." (2) The work is
not that of a minister or a church officer. "In some cases they will need to counsel with the
church officers or the minister." Evidently this work is not that of an elder or minister. (3) It
was a ministry different from what we were already doing. The portion quoted here is
followed immediately by, "This is another means of strengthening and building up the church.
We need to branch out more in our methods of labor." (4) It appears in an article entitled,
"The Duty of the Minister and the People," which called upon ministers to allow and
101
encourage the church members to use their talents for the Lord. The last sentence of the
quoted paragraph reflects this thrust: "Place the burdens upon men and women of the church,
that they may grow by reason of the exercise, and thus become effective agents in the hand of
the Lord for the enlightenment of those who sit in darkness."
This is the only statement from Mrs. White addressing laying on of hands for women.
The statement and its context clearly indicate that these women were being dedicated to a
specific lay ministry, not the ministry of elders or pastors. For more on this, see William
Fagal's work cited in the previous note; see also Samuel Koranteng-Pipim, Searching the
Scriptures, pp. 21-23.

L. White published the information regarding these matters in the introduction to his article,
"Ellen G. White the Person," Spectrum 4/2 (Spring, 1972):7.

43. In 1965, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that in order for
licensed ministers (i.e., full-time, non-ordained men and women workers of the church) to
continue receiving parsonage allowance and other tax benefits reserved only for ordained
ministers, and for their employing organizations not to be required to pay substantial Social
Security taxes for them, they must be "fully qualified to exercise all of the ecclesiastical
duties" of the ordained ministry. Space limitations prevent our going into the history of how,
beginning in 1966, the desire to continue enjoying the U.S. tax benefits influenced
administrators at church council meetings in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1984, and
1989 gradually to change the long-standing Adventist theology of the ordained ministry. Bert
B. Haloviak provided a brief account in "The Internal Revenue Service and the Redefinition
of Adventist Ministry," Adventist Today (May-June 1996), pp. 12-15. Haloviak concluded
with this perceptive comment: "The interrelationship between money, theology, the IRS, and
church administration had converged to create a moral dilemma within the Seventh-day
Adventist Church" (ibid., p. 15). With the hindsight of considering the tumultuous events
leading up to and following the women's ordination debates at the 1990 and 1995 General
Conference sessions, one wonders if the desire for tax benefits in a particular country was
sufficient reason to plunge the worldwide church into a theological, hermeneutical, and
ecclesiastical crisis.
44. With respect to the first option, Adventists Affirm, with contribution and counsel of
other Adventist scholars and church leaders, prepared an appeal to church leadership in 1989
which said in part: "The United States tax code problem which prompted the 1977 action no
longer exists. Would it not be simpler to rescind our action and return to the practice the
church had long maintained, and which it still follows in most of the world? This would
provide one policy for the unity of the world church, remove the unequal treatment of
unordained men and women serving in their variou pastoral roles, and restore something of
the significance of ordination in North America" (see "An Appeal to the World Field
Regarding the Ministry of Women in the Church," Adventists Affirm 3/2 [Fall 1989]:11). This
appeal, however, went unheeded by those who favored option two. Thus in the events leading
to the 1995 Utrecht General Conference session, the North American Division still argued for
"No Turning Back" on the ordination of women as elders and pastors. See, for example,
Alfred C. McClure, "NAD's President Speaks on Women's Ordination: Why Should
Ordination be Gender Inclusive?" Adventist Review [NAD edition], February 1995, pp. 14-15;
cf. Gary Patterson, "Let Divisions Decide When to Ordain Women," Spectrum 24/2 (April
1995), pp. 36-42. For responses to the above view, see the articles by Ethel R. Nelson, "'No
Turning Back' on Ordination?" and C. Mervyn Maxwell, "Response to NAD President's

48. Those desiring to explore 1 Tim 2:11ff. in greater depth will benefit from the
following works: Andreas J. Köstenberger, Thomas R. Schreiner, and H. Scott Baldwin, eds.,
Women in the Church: A Fresh Analysis of 1 Timothy 2:9-15 (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker,
1995), a ground-breaking work that takes a closer look at the background, lexicography,
grammar, and exegesis of 1 Tim 2:9-15. Two articles in this volume deserve special mention.
First, H. Scott Baldwin's "A Difficult Word in 1 Timothy 2:12" offers a compelling argument
that the Greek word authentein can only be translated as "to have authority over"; this
decisively excludes meanings such as "instigate violence," "murder," or "proclaim oneself
author of a man." Second, Andreas J. Köstenberger's "A Difficult Sentence Structure in 1
Timothy 2:12" analyzed the syntactical structure of Paul's statement, "I do not permit a
woman to teach or to have authority over a man," showing that the grammatical structure in
the Greek ("not + [verb 1] + neither + [verb 2]") suggests that if "teach" is viewed positively
in 1 Timothy (which it is), then "have authority" must also be an action that is viewed
positively, but prohibited for reasons other than the inherent wrongness of the activity of
"having authority" in itself. This powerful argument discredits interpretations such as
"domineer" or "instigate violence." Another significant work is Wayne Grudem's "The
Meaning of 'kephale,' ('head'): A Response to Recent Studies," appendix in Recovering
Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism, ed. John Piper and
Wayne Grudem (Wheaton, Ill.: Crossway, 1991), pp. 425-468; this work challenges the
unfounded speculation that the Greek word kephale (head) should be translated as "source"
rather than its real meaning as "authority." Bruce Waltke, "1 Tim. 2:8-15: Unique or
Normative?" Crux 28/1 (March 1992):22-27, answers the common objection that 1 Timothy
2:8-15 only applies to a particular situation at that time, and not to all churches for all time;
cf. Wayne Grudem, "Why Paul Allows Women to Prophesy but not Teach in Church,"
Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 30/1 (March 1987):11-23; cf. Douglas Moo,
"What Does It Mean Not to Tach or Have Authority Over Men?: 1 Timothy 2:11-15," in
Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, pp. 179-193; D. A. Carson, "'Silent in the
Churches': On the Role of Women in 1 Corinthians 14:33b-36," in Recovering Biblical
Manhood and Womanhood, pp. 140-153. Finally, Guenther Haas, "Patriarchy as An Evil that
God Tolerated: Analysis and Implications for the Authority of Scripture," Journal of the
Evangelical Theological Society 38/3 (September 1995):321-326, shows how rejecting the
biblical teaching of headship has far-reaching implications for one's view of God and the
authority of Scripture.

Neall admits that his article is built on the work of Catherine and Richard Kroeger, I Suffer
Not a Woman: Rethinking 1 Timothy 2:11-15 in Light of Ancient Evidence (Grand Rapids,
Mich.: Baker, 1992). For a succinct critique of Neall's work, see Keith Burton, "At God's
Table, Women Sit Where They Are Told," Spectrum 25/3 (March 1996):55-57, especially
note 16. Adventists who join Catherine Kroeger, President of Christians for Biblical Equality,
and her husband Richard in advancing a Gnostic hypothesis as an explanation of Paul's
statement in 1 Tim 2:11ff. are apparently unaware of the serious flaws in the hypothesis. A
helpful critique can be found in Stephen Baugh, "The Apostle Among the Amazons" (a
review of Richard and Catherine Kroeger, I Suffer Not a Woman (Baker, 1992), Westminster
Theological Journal 56 (1994):153-171; Albert Wolters, review of I Suffer Not a Woman,

51. See note 50. A Gnostic/feminist hypothesis similar to that of the Kroegers is found in
Sharon Marie Hodgin Gritz's A Study of 1 Timothy 2:9-15 in Light of the Religious and
Cultural Milieu of the First Century (Ph.D. dissertation, Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary, 1986). For a detailed critique and correction of works such as the Kroegers' and
Gritz's, see Stephen Baugh's "A Foreign World: Ephesus in the First Century" in Andreas J.
Köstenberger, Thomas R. Schreiner, and H. Scott Baldwin, eds., Women in the Church: A

40-page analysis of Ephesus in the First Century dismisses the unfounded speculations of
such works. Cf. C. Mervyn Maxwell, "Women in the Greco-Roman World," a study paper for

DEPARTING FROM THE WORD
PART III
The Bible – Fully or Partially Trustworthy?
Objective. In this section we shall explore to what extent higher-critical assumptions are
influencing Seventh-day Adventist views on the reliability of the Bible writers' accounts,
Ellen White's position on the Bible's trustworthiness, the New Testament's use of the Old
Testament, and the alleged contradictions in parallel accounts in the Bible.
Key Issue. Is the Bible fully or partially trustworthy?
Traditional Adventist Belief. Bible-believing students accept the Bible's full reliability in
matters of salvation as well as on any other subject the Bible touches upon. When the Bible
writers describe an account as actually taking place, we are to believe it as trustworthy. The
apostle Peter wrote: "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his
majesty" (2 Pet 1:16; cf. 1 Cor 2:10-13). John wrote: "The man who saw it has given
testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that
you also may believe" (John 19:35 NIV); and Luke stated: "Therefore, since I myself have
carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an
orderly account for you. . ." (Luke 1:3 NIV).
Mainstream Adventism believes that the biblical accounts--including those touching upon
science, history, geography, and other matters--are fully reliable and trustworthy. When the
Bible says that the creation took six literal days, that there was a universal flood in Noah's
day, an exodus of some 600,000 men from Egypt, and that the sun stood still in Joshua's day,
we are to believe that the events actually took place. When the New Testament writers
pointed to events in their day as fulfilling Old Testament prophecies, they were not mistaken,
nor did they read the Old Testament out of context.
The first article of Seventh-day Adventists' "Fundamental Beliefs" emphasizes the
trustworthiness of Scripture by stating: "The Holy Scriptures are the infallible revelation of
His will. They are the standard of character, the test of experience, the authoritative revealer
of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history." Ellen G. White wrote that
the Holy Scriptures "are to be accepted as an authoritative, infallible revelation of His [God's]
will" (The Great Controversy, p. vii; cf. pp. 68, 102); they are "the only infallible authority in
religion" (ibid., p. 238; see also pp. 89, 177), and "the only sufficient, infallible rule" (ibid., p.
173).
For Ellen White, Scripture shares in the infallibility of God. "God and heaven alone are
infallible" (Selected Messages, 1:37; cf. Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 30, 105). "Man is
fallible, but God's Word is infallible" (Selected Messages, 1:416). She left no doubt that the
Bible is "an unerring counselor and infallible guide" and the "perfect guide under all
circumstances of life";1 "an unerring guide," "the one unerring guide," "the unerring
standard," "a unerring light," "that unerring test," and "the unerring counsel of God."2
106
Theological Assumption. The theological assumption undergirding the trustworthiness of
Scripture is the character of the triune God. Since what a person says reflects his character,
we would expect that if God is the God of truth (Ex 34:6; Deut 32:4), if Jesus is Truth (John
14:6), and if the Holy Spirit is Truth (John 14:17), then the Triune God who has spoken in
Scripture must speak the truth. Because God's Word says that God does not lie (Num 23:19; 1
Sam 15:29; Titus 1:2; Heb 6:18), Bible-believing Christians maintain that His inspired Word
speaks the truth.
But in their efforts to appear "scientific," theological liberals do not accept the reliability of
the accounts in Scripture. They seek to reconstruct the Bible according to what they think
probably happened, and in some cases they argue that the inspired New Testament writers
were wrong in how they used the Old Testament.
How are historical-critical assumptions influencing Adventist views on Scripture's
trustworthiness?
Effect of the Liberal Approach
While our scholars who subscribe to contemporary higher criticism reject some of the
anti-supernatural presuppositions of "radical" liberals and hence give an appearance of being
Bible-believing Adventists, they maintain nonetheless that the Bible is not fully reliable since
it contains some "mistakes" or "exaggerations." The alleged "mistakes" include so-called
"discrepancies," "inconsistences," and "inaccuracies" in its statements about chronology,
numbers, genealogy, history, geography, and science. Believing that they can use the
historical-critical method without adopting the skeptical and naturalistic assumptions on
which it is based, proponents of the method resort to reconstructing or reinterpreting the
biblical accounts.
First, they downgrade biblical certainties into probabilities and probabilities into
possibilities. Then they upgrade the possibilities of their reconstructed accounts into
probabilities and probabilities into certainties. They present the result of this "objective" or
"scientific" historical inquiry to unsuspecting church members as a mark of scholarly
enlightenment. And anyone who does not accept these reconstructions is classified as
"narrow-minded," "literalistic," or "fundamentalistic" in thinking!
The Biblical Accounts. The book Inspiration, for example, denies the trustworthiness of
certain scriptural accounts. In it (a) the author makes a dichotomy between saving acts and
factual statements, so that in scriptural accounts some things are "essential" and others are
"debatable";3 (b) he rejects the Bible's claim that the original sanctuary in the wilderness was
constructed as a copy of the heavenly (Ex 25:40), suggesting that the idea was borrowed from
surrounding Canaanites and that the book of Hebrews interprets the "heavenly" sanctuary in
terms of Platonic dualism;4 (c) he accepts the miracle of the Exodus but maintains that the
exact "number of people involved in the Exodus is not that crucial";5 (d) he acknowledges a
miraculous flood in Noah's day but holds that the biblical flood was "less than [a] universal
event";6 (e) he believes in biblical history and yet argues that information on numbers,
genealogies, and dates may have been "distorted."7 Do Seventh-day Adventist interpreters do
well to deny or question the trustworthiness of Scripture?
Revising of Ellen White's View. Some Adventist scholars subtly suggest that while the
Bible is infallible in matters of salvation, the same cannot be said bout the factual, historical,
or scientific accounts in Scripture. An Adventist historian who offers a nuanced endorsement
of Inspiration even goes so far as to make Ellen G. White a party to his own "moderate stance
107
on inspiration," which he also terms a "common-sense flexibility on inspiration." Without any
shred of support from Ellen White and contrary to what she unambiguously asserted in
several places in her works, he popularizes his revisionist reinterpretation of Ellen White's
position: "The Bible, she held, was infallible in the realm of salvation, but it was not infallible
or inerrant in the radical sense of being beyond any possibility of factual difficulties or
errors"!8 One searches in vain for such a statement from Ellen White.
The Genesis Account. In the same spirit of distinguishing between the Bible's theological
statements as infallible and the accompanying historical facts as debatable, a contributor to
the book, The Welcome Table, uses "sanctified imagination" to assert: "First we need to make
clear what Genesis 2 is and what it isn't. It is a story of beginnings, a story to instruct and
even entertain, told in such a fashion as to be easily remembered and retold. It is not history
or science."9 In other words, we cannot always trust the historical or scientific accuracy of
Genesis 2.
Also, contrary to the Bible's clear teaching that Adam was a male, this writer states: "Even
though we may deduce that the first human being was a male being, the storyteller does not
specifically say so." She suggests that Adam is presented as "an androgynous being" (i.e.
bisexual)!10
The obliteration of gender differentiation in Genesis 2 is only a few steps away from
positing homosexuality or bisexuality in the first created pair. And since human beings were
created in God's image, if Adam was "an androgynous being" does it not mean that God also
is androgynous? One wonders what is really behind the gender-inclusive reconstructions of
the Bible: "Son of God" becomes "Child of God"; "Son of Man" becomes "Human one"; "our
heavenly Father" becomes "our heavenly Parent."11 Is this also the reason why an Adventist
author promotes the Holy Spirit as the female member of the Godhead and repeatedly refers
to the Creator as "He/She"?12
The New Testament Use of the Old. Scholars highlight the alleged distortion of the
biblical message when they express their views on how New Testament writers used the Old
Testament. They maintain that, using rabbinic methods current in their times, the writers of
the New Testament sometimes read back into Old Testament passages meanings that were
foreign to the original meaning.13 This implies that we cannot always trust the New Testament
writers, since they allegedly took texts out of context and imposed their own meanings upon
them.
Apparently believing that he understands the Old Testament better than the apostle Paul
did, one author maintains that Paul misused Isaiah 64:4 in his quotation of 1 Corinthians 2:9:
"It appears Paul used Old Testament verses out of context on occasion as he wrote in the New
Testament!"14 Similarly, others suggest that though the inspired writer Matthew cited Isaiah
7:14, Hosea 11:1, and Jeremiah 31:15 as prophecies in connection with Jesus's birth,
childhood, and flight to Egypt to escape Herod's massacre, each of the Old Testament verses
was "not intended as a prophecy at all." In other words, Matthew used the Old Testament out
of context.15
What makes these authors think they have a better understanding of the Old Testament
than the inspired writers of the New Testament had?
Alleged Contradictions in Parallel Accounts. Another effort to undermine the
trustworthiness of Scripture is the suggestion that there are discrepancies or contradictions in
parallel accounts of the Bible. The euphemistic term often employed is "diversity" or
"differences" in Scriptures. For instance, one teacher and Adventist university chaplain cites
108
as an "obvious example" of "theological contradictions in the Bible" the apparent discrepancy
between 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 a point that is also made in Inspiration.16 In
Chapter Ten we shall show that the so-called "theological contradiction" does not reside in
the biblical texts, but rather in the imagination of scholars conditioned by the
historical-critical methodology.
Similarly, an Adventist New Testament scholar employs redaction criticism (an aspect of
the historical-critical method) in his book, Luke, A Plagiarist? He attempts to show that the
gospel writers performed major "surgery" on the sayings of Jesus which they reported.
Differences between parallel accounts in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are the result of
these writers' editorial genius in deliberately introducing some "minor" or "even more radical"
"discrepancies" or "changes" into their sources (the actual teachings of Christ). The author
explains that "each change makes a contribution to what the writer is saying about Jesus."
Thus, two of his chapter titles are: "Small, Unimportant Changes" and "Large, Important
Changes."17
Unlike the publishers of Inspiration, who apparently did not recognize that the book was
the product of historical-critical viewpoints,18 the publishers of Luke, A Plagiarist?
judiciously included a disclaimer: "The purpose of this book is to investigate a concept of
inspiration not generally held by most Seventh-day Adventists. . . . This book does not
represent an official pronouncement of the Seventh-day Adventist Church nor does it
necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the Pacific Press Publishing Association." In any
case, both historical-critical works from Adventist publishing houses suggest that differences
in parallel accounts in the Bible constitute contradictions.
In a similar fashion, the author of Inspiration, building his "incarnational view of
inspiration" on alleged discrepancies in Scripture (technically referred to as the "phenomena"
of Scripture), writes: "Certainly the differences between the two editions of the decalogue
(Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5) suggest that we do not know precisely what came from
God's finger when he inscribed the law on tables of stone, yet we would certainly say that the
decalogue is 'revelation.'" He also maintains that "the gospel writers could differ from one
another in their recording and interpreting of Gospel traditions, being more concerned about
practical application than absolute historical precision."19 The coded message is that we may
not always rely on the accounts of Moses and the gospel writers as fully trustworthy.
If the content of the Ten Commandments cannot be known precisely, on what basis was
Paul led to declare the law "holy, and just, and good" (Rom 7:12)? And how can human
beings be expected to obey a law of which they are not sure?
Many more examples can be cited to show how higher-critical assumptions are shaping the
views of some regarding the reliability or trustworthiness of parallel biblical accounts. The
allegation that there are two different, even contradictory, creation accounts (Gen 1 and 2)
and flood narratives (Gen 6-9) provides two more examples that are often cited.20 But the
above are enough to illustrate our point.
Notice the three major implications of maintaining that the differences in parallel accounts
are contradictions. First, it suggests that today's scholar may use historical-critical principles
of interpretation to determine the factual trustworthiness of biblical accounts.21 Second,
attempts by Bible-believing Adventists to harmonize apparent discrepancies in parallel
accounts of Scripture are often dismissed as "proof-text" method. Third, since in the Bible we
supposedly find evidence of inspired writers holding contradictory views, the Adventist
church should allow "diversity" of views (i.e., contradictory theologies) in the church. This is
the recipe for theological pluralism, which holds that conflicting theological views are
legitimate and must be allowed to cohabit in the same church.22
109
A Bible-Believing Adventist Response
How should Bible-believing Seventh-day Adventists respond to such an approach?
Proponents of the historical-critical method claim that "objectivity in exegesis
[interpretation]" and not "proof-text subjectivity" is the goal of biblical study.23 Yet their
approach is a true expression of "proof-text subjectivity." For instead of exegesis (reading out
of the text what is already there), they practice eisegesis (reading into the text what was not
originally there). Instead of a faithful exposition of the biblical text, they make an imposition
on the text, as we have shown in the several preceding pages. How can the historical-critical
method be "objective" when speculation overshadows evidence and when twentieth-century
liberal assumptions reduce the inspired message to a mere reflection of the scholars' own
ideological convictions? To the extent that it does this, the historical-critical method is the
worst kind of proof-texting.
Historical Trustworthiness. Bible-believing Adventists welcome the inquiry of those
who accept what Scripture says as trustworthy and who desire simply to learn its meaning.
What they reject is the intrusion of unbiblical assumptions drawn from secular thought (e.g.,
Romantic philosophy and evolutionary philosophy) as the basis to judge the credibility of the
biblical record and to reconstruct what actually happened. The "historical" interpretation of
the historical-critical method, if adopted, will breed a "new papalism" of scholars, since
ordinary laypeople who are not trained as "historians" will be expected to depend on the
experts for understanding the contents of the Christian faith. Besides, such a historical
approach fails to show a way out should the "historical" experts disagree.
Ellen White expressed the conviction of Bible-believing students when she argued for the
trustworthiness of Scripture in all that it teaches and touches upon--whether in the realm of
salvation or in the sphere of history, science, etc. Against those who questioned the historical
reliability of Scripture, she asserted that because the Holy Spirit "guided the pens of the
sacred historians" (Gospel Workers, p. 286), biblical history is truthful, authentic, and reliable
(Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 84-85; Testimonies for the Church, 4:9-10). The
accounts in the Bible are not sullied by human pride or prejudice (Education, p. 173;
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 596; Testimonies for the Church, 5:25). "The unerring pen of
inspiration" traces biblical history with "exact fidelity" (ibid., 4:370). The Bible is equally
trustworthy even in its statements having to do with scientific issues--e.g., questions about
origins and geology (Education, pp. 128-130).24
Summarizing his findings from an extensive study of Ellen White's writings, a
knowledgeable Adventist professor of church history and historical theology writes:
"Although Ellen White recognized the existence of difficulties in Scripture, I have been
unable to find any instance in which she mentioned specific factual errors in the Scriptures.
As silent as the writers of the New Testament had been in pointing out factual errors in the
Old Testament, so was Ellen White in regard to the total canon of Scripture."25 In other
words, if none of the inspired prophets felt himself authorized to criticize alleged "errors" of
his predecessors, why should we? Are we more enlightened for such a task than the prophets
themselves?
Bible-believing Adventists, therefore, reject the kind of thinking that does not want to
accept or obey what Scripture explicitly affirms. They also reject the kind of "sanctified
reason" which does not make logically correct deductions from Scripture itself, and which
makes an uninspired interpreter sit i judgment over God's Word to decide what to accept as
true. Such "sanctified reason" does not merit the label of "science" or "Christian." It is not
"scientific" because, rather than being a scientific inquiry into the truths of God's Word, it sets
110
about "dissecting, conjecturing, reconstructing" the Bible (see The Acts of the Apostles, p.
474). And it is not "Christian," because instead of submitting to the Book that will judge
human reason, it dares to sit in judgment and overthrow the authority of the Bible.
Critical Thinking. In opposition to "Methods of Bible Study" (the Rio document that
urged Adventist scholars not to use the historical-critical method in any of its forms), a
proponent of modern higher criticism gives the impression that the church is opposed to
"critical thinking," understood as objective thinking. He explains that the goal of
historical-critical Adventist scholars was to be "'critical' in the sense that it attempted to
discriminate between fact and fiction. The idea that the word 'critical' in the term
'historical-critical' expresses a critical attitude toward the inspiration and authority of the
Bible reflects the uninformed thinking of those who do not understand the nature and purpose
of the method or who have ulterior motives for opposing it."26
Does rejecting the historical-critical method reflect "the uninformed thinking" of
Bible-believing Adventists who are against the use of liberal methodology? Not so.
The difference between the traditional Adventist plain reading of Scripture and the
contemporary liberal approach is not that the latter is "critical" while the former is not; both
are "critical," depending upon how one defines the term.
If by critical interpretation we mean the answering of questions about the date, place,
sources, background, literary character, credentials, and purposes of each biblical book or
composition, then Bible-believing Adventists will have no difficulty in describing their own
approach as "critical." If, however, the term implies charging the Bible with
untrustworthiness or fraudulence of any kind (which is what proponents of the
historical-critical method intimate), then Bible-believing Adventists are opposed to it.
Christians who are tempted to adopt historical-critical reasoning face a major dilemma.
How do they exalt the Bible as the judge of human errors and at the same time keep the
human interpreter as the arbiter of Scripture's errors? How can they commend the Bible as a
true witness yet charge it with falsehood? Is this not theological double-talk?
Careless and Superficial Analysis. Superficial works may fill useful functions. But it is
always regrettable when superficial analyses of parallel accounts are presented to
unsuspecting church members as though they were biblically profound works. Later in this
book, we shall take a look at some of the biblical passages alleged to be contradictions.
Presently, however, we must only remind ourselves of a statement by Ellen White: "As
several [Bible] writers present a subject under varied aspects and relations, there may appear,
to the superficial, careless, or prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or contradiction, where
the thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer insight, discerns the underlying harmony" (The
Great Controversy, p. vi, emphasis supplied).
"Men of ability have devoted a lifetime of study and prayer to the searching of the
Scriptures, and yet there are many portions of the Bible that have not been fully explored.
Some passages of Scripture will never be perfectly comprehended until in the future life
Christ shall explain them. There are mysteries to be unraveled, statements that human minds
cannot harmonize. And the enemy will seek to arouse argument upon these points, which
might better remain undiscussed" (Gospel Workers, p. 312).
Need for Caution. The history of biblical interpretation teaches us that some Bible
difficulties that once appeared to be "contradictions" or "errors" were nothing more than
optical illusions. For this reason, we must be careful that in our haste to obtain an "objective"
or "scientific" explanation we are not tempted to declare those nresolved Bible difficulties as
111
"distortions," "contradictions," "inconsistencies," or "demonstrable errors of fact."
Instead, when faced with unresolved Bible difficulties, we should make a painstaking and
prayerful effort to study them in the light of Scripture itself. We should look at what other
scholars and Bible students have said about the same subject to ascertain the extent to which
their solutions are in agreement with the Bible itself. We should also pay close attention to
what Ellen G. White has to say on the issue since we believe that an inspired writer is always
a more dependable interpreter of a Bible passage than are contemporary scholars. If we still
do not get a handle on the difficulty, we should suspend judgment till such a time as the Lord
sheds further light on the problem passage. And He does!27

20. This is the so-called documentary hypothesis. According to this liberal theory, Moses
did not write the first five books of the Bible. The scholars hypothesize that they were written
roughly between the time of David and the second century B.C. by many authors and
compilers. One hypothetical author is called J, because he always called God "Jehovah."
Another is known as E, because he chose the Hebrew word Elohim for God. There was also
D, who is believed to have written Deuteronomy, and P, from the priestly class. Based on this
hypothesis, higher-critical scholars chop up the Bible into pieces according to whether the
section uses the word Jehovah or Elohim, or if it contains references to priestly activity or
concerns. This is one reason why Genesis 1 and 2 are supposed to contain two different, even
contradictory, creation accounts. Of course, within each imaginary compiler, there were a lot
of other members so that documents like D could be split into D the first, D the second, etc.

DEPARTING FROM THE WORD
PART IV
The Bible – Progressive Revelation or Progressive Ideas?
Objective. In this section we shall examine to what extent higher-critical assumptions are
influencing Seventh-day Adventist views on human relationships, the Spirit's ongoing divine
guidance, concepts of God, divine judgment, the doctrine of hell, and the nature of "present
truth."
Key Issue. How should we understand the nature of "progressive revelation"? Is it an
unfolding of the meaning and import of previously disclosed truth, or is it a revelation of new
truths that are not already present in the Bible?
Traditional Adventist Belief. Historically, Adventists have understood "progressive
revelation" to mean an ever increasing unfolding or expansion of what was previously
revealed. They have often referred to this as "present truth," arguing that new truth does not
contradict previously revealed truth.1 Thus, the preamble to our Fundamental Beliefs speaks
of how "the church is led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth or finds
better language in which to express the teachings of God's Holy Word."
But as is common in liberal theology, proponents of the historical-critical method have
taken this good concept and redefined it according to the myth of evolutionism. To promote
their "dynamic concept of truth," they disguise it as the "Holy Spirit's leading"--when it is
actually the spirit of the modern age which is driving them. They claim that "progressive
revelation" is the Holy Spirit's guidance into truths that were not previously revealed by the
Bible writers, and which may at times be contradictory to established Bible truth. Thus they
abandon God's absolute truth for liberalism's "dynamic truth"; and they replace the true
progressive (i.e. unfolding) revelation of His written Word with the allegedly "progressive"
ideas of our contemporary culture.
How are historical-critical assumptions shaping Adventist views on the interpretation of
Scripture?
Effect of the Liberal Approach
Reinterpreting progressive revelation to mean the disclosure of new truths to supplant old
ones is another variation of the cultural conditioning argument discussed in part two of this
chapter. In this respect, those who maintain that some parts of the Bible are culturally
conditioned will also tend to hold the new views regarding progressive revelation.
Human Relationships. Proponents of the new approaches to the Bible do not overtly deny
the absolute nature of Biblical truth.Yet by viewing truth as dynamic or evolutionary--at least
in such matters as male-female roles, polygamy, and homosexuality--they are leaning in that
direction.
For example, although they acknowledge that male headship and the female supportive
roles are taught in both the Old and New Testaments, they argue that these directives were not
meant for all time. The teachings were meant to evolve and change with culture. Another
example is marriage, which they believe to have evolved from the widespread polygamy in
the Old Testament (Abraham, Jacob, Isaac, David, etc.)2 towards monogamous relationships
115
in the New Testament, and now, some would argue, should include a closed couple
homosexual relationship.3
Even when confronted with the evidence that, in Eden prior to the fall, God instituted
male-female role differentiation and monogamous (not polygamous), heterosexual (not
homosexual) marriage, such proponents may respond that Genesis 1 and 2 are not historical;
and even if they are historical, Adam was androgynous (bisexual). An un-historical creation
account and an androgynous Adam both nullify the biblical case for divinely instituted role
differences and a monogamous heterosexual relationship.
A few examples will illustrate this new understanding of "progressive revelation."
The Spirit's Guidance Today. Bible-believing Adventists hold that there are no
theological contradictions or discrepancies in Scripture. However, a historical-critical
proponent responds: "The objection to such a view of inspiration would be that it does not
recognize the developmental process behind doctrinal truths which unfold in Scripture, and
fails to account for theological contradictions in the Bible."4
A favorite illustration for liberalism's "dynamic truth" of progressive revelation5 is how the
Holy Spirit allegedly guided Paul to contravene His explicit instructions at the Jerusalem
Council. In Acts 15:28, 29, the Spirit guided the Jerusalem Council to lay down as a binding
obligation to Christians that they should abstain from "meats offered to idols, and from blood,
and from things strangled, and from fornication." These "necessary" prohibitions were
binding on all churches (Acts 15:28; 16:4; 21:25; Rev 2:14, 20).6 But in 1 Corinthians 8 and
10, Paul appears to set aside the Spirit-inspired command of Acts 15 when he stated that the
Corinthians could eat meat offered to idols.
To some Adventist scholars, this is a prime example of how the Holy Spirit overrules a
binding moral command given in an earlier time.7 It could also suggest to them that what may
be morally forbidden to Christians in one culture could be morally acceptable in another.
Notice, however, that a careful study of 1 Corinthians 8 and 10 does not validate the
conclusions of these scholars.8 This reinterpretation of progressive revelation is based on an
assumption that there is no underlying unity in the various parts of Scripture. If we view the
Scriptures as a divine document as much as human, we will seek to discover the underlying
harmony among Scriptures that may at first seem contradictory.
But under the impact of historical-critical assumptions, some scholars cast doubt on the
basic unity of the Bible. One Adventist scholar dismisses it as "the traditional theoretical
model of the unity of Scripture." In his opinion there are "differences" in the Bible, a
euphemism for alleged contradictions, discrepancies, and mistakes.9
Denying the Bible's unity makes it impossible to maintain the validity of comparing
Scripture with Scripture as Jesus did on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:27). Can this explain
the uneasiness of some scholars to do topical Bible study, dismissing it as a "proof-text" or
"key-text" method? Can this also explain the claim by some that later Bible writers cannot be
reliable interpreters of earlier inspired writers?
A God Who Keeps Changing. Rejecting the internal unity of Scripture, one "progressive
Adventist" professor takes a "dynamic" view of Scripture. The picture of God revealed in
both Testaments, she says, was merely the views of the Bible writers as they understood God
in their time. Thus, in the Bible we find God evolving from the violent, blood-thirsty God of
the Old Testament to the kind and gentle God of the New. She writes: "The belief in
progressive revelation makes us aware that our pictures of God keep changing. . . . There is
enough internal evidence, as scholars have shown, to suggest that as one reads through the
Bible, a loving monotheistic God emerges from a pantheon of warlike gods. The progressive
116
Adventist believes that the picture of God blotting out populations either by the sword of
man, or by fires, earthquakes, catastrophic storms, and volcanic eruptions, demonstrates that
man has indeed made god in his own image."10
This "progressive Adventist" belief is a variation of the cultural conditioning argument,
claiming that the inspired accounts in the Old Testament were colored by the Bible writers'
cultural understanding of God; the Old Testament pictures of God were a creation in their
"own image." The above scholar's idea that there are "differences" between the Old and New
Testament pictures of God is an old heresy--Marcionism--being recycled as new truth for our
enlightened age.
How can the biblical God who says "I am the Lord, I change not" (Mal 3:6) evolve from a
"pantheon of warlike gods" into the "loving monotheistic God" that we know Him to be? Can
such a God be trusted? Can we place our future into His hands? When friends and loved ones
we trust change, we are disappointed. How can we be sure that the God we know today will
not change tomorrow?
An Open View of God. The above questions are partly answered in another example, a
more technical book based on essentially the same idea of "progressive revelation." In this
controversial book, The Openness of God: The Relationship of Divine Foreknowledge and
Human Free Will, a professor of theology proposes an "open view of God" on the basis of the
evolutionary philosophy called "process theology." He sees God as evolving in His
knowledge of things: though God knows everything that has happened in the past, He does
not know absolutely what will take place in the future. He only knows "possible" things that
may happen in the future, but not necessarily exactly how they will be.
The author says: "The central claim of this alternative view is that God's experience of the
world is open rather than closed. God's experience does not consist of one timeless intuition.
He does not have one eternal perception of all reality, past and future. . . . Another way to
make the point is to say that time is real for God. His experience is the infallible register of
temporal reality. It reflects every event and development in the temporal world. All that
happens enters His memory, is retained forever. Nothing escapes His notice." In other words,
God knows perfectly what has happened in the past.
But now notice what follows: "But God's experience is also the progressive register of
reality. Events enter His experience as they happen, not before [meaning God does not know
perfectly what will happen in the future]. This means that God experiences the past and the
future differently. They are not the same for Him. He remembers the past exhaustively, in all
its detail. Every aspect is vividly present to His mind. But His experience of the future is
different. He anticipates the future, to be sure, and in a way unique to Him, as we shall see.
But the future retains its essential indefiniteness from God's perspective as well as from
ours."11
When one accepts the logic of an "open view of God," the prophecies of Daniel,
Revelation, and The Great Controversy become essentially untenable!12 If God does not know
the future perfectly, either these "prophecies" were written after the events took place, or at
best, they are accurate "guesses" by God.
For this theology professor, "the future is not absolutely foreknowable" even to God.
Rather, God "faces the future with complete foresight" or an "anticipation" which involves
His "knowing what might happen" and how He should respond. God merely knows "a great
deal about the future" as determined by past and present human causes. God "knows exactly
what some of His own future actions willbe" when they are not dependent on human actions.
But "God does not know the future absolutely. He nevertheless anticipates it perfectly. But it
[God's perfect anticipation] does not consist in knowing everything that actually will
117
happen."13
Many questions still remain: If God does not know the future in all its details, can we
really speak about Bible prophecies at all? How was God able to guarantee to
Nebuchadnezzar through Daniel, "The dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure"
(Dan 2:45)? Can God give accurate prophecies about end-time events, such as the final
conflict between God's last-day remnant church and the apostate powers of the enemy?
Are such "progressive" reinterpretations of God an underlying reason why some of our
scholars are repudiating traditional Adventism's doctrine of last-day events (eschatology)?
One historical-critical author asserts: "It is a sobering and scary thought to conclude that our
eschatology has been built on an unsound foundation, and that it has ultimately done us more
harm than good. In a word, it has made us an 'ethnocentric' people."14
A "Friendly" God Who Doesn't Destroy. Offended by the apparent biblical teaching that
God sometimes expresses His divine "wrath" upon sinners by acts of divine retribution, some
Adventist authors see such acts of God as merely disciplinary, or at best as simply figures of
speech.
In an influential book, Servants or Friends? Another Look at God, an Adventist scholar
rejects the Bible's assertions that God actually punishes sinners in retributive judgment, even
at the end of the world. In his opinion, the references in the Bible that speak of God's
displaying His wrath in retribution on sinners are examples of His communicating to us "in
our ignorance and immaturity"--using "dark speech" that God's "friends" know how to
explain.
Based on his "matured" view of God as our "friend," this scholar explains that the "many
references in the Bible to God's destruction of the wicked" must be understood as God's "just
using a figure of speech."15
Commendably, this progressive reinterpretation of the Bible seeks to move beyond the
"more ferocious" and "cruel" picture of God that many see in Scripture to a more "friendly"
one. But in using as its measure such human standards as how a mother would treat her
misbehaving children, it casts God in man's image and seeks to explain away Bible evidence
contrary to its attractive conclusions.
This view necessarily affects one's understanding of our Savior's work. If God chooses not
to punish sinners retributively, and if the biblical references to God's doing so are mere
metaphors, then for this scholar, Jesus could not have experienced God's retributive
punishment for our sin. In short, this teacher's view of God has led him and others to
reinterpret the biblical doctrine of the substitutionary atonement of Christ (found in, for
example, Isa 53:4-12, 2 Cor 5:21; cf. The Desire of Ages, p. 25 ["Christ was treated as we
deserve . . ."]).16
New Teaching on Hell. "Progressives" who hold to the "friendly" view of God tend to
reinterpret the biblical doctrine of hell. One such scholar understands hell as merely a "vision
of reality" that "fills the wicked with intense mental anguish and remorse. Their mental
suffering, like the suffering of Jesus--who died on Calvary from a broken heart--surpasses any
kind of physical suffering and is the direct result of sin. This is the agony of Hell. God does
not add any kind of punishment to the consequences of sin to make Hell worse than it already
is, any more that [sic] a loving parent would spank the scalded body of a disobedient child
who pulled a boiling kettle off the stove. Hell is full realization of sin."17
A 1986 Seventh-day Adventist devotional book, translated into several languages and read
by thousands of Adventists around the world, also rejects the Bible's teaching that sinners will
ultimately be destroyed in hell-fire. His Healing Love explains that hell is merely a separation
118
or disconnection from God. In answer to his own question, "How hot is hell?" the author
employs the analogy of a light bul and its power source:
"The day will come when those who refuse His [God's] gracious invitation for friendship
will be given what they have chosen: separation from Him. When you unplug your lamp, it
doesn't explode. The light just goes out. Nor do you need to beat on the bulb in anger for its
ceasing to give light. That's simply what happens when it is disconnected. By the same token,
when one breaks union with God, life ceases. God does not, in anger, need to crush it out. . . .
To be separated from the Life-giver is to be dead eternally."18
In his opinion the biblical references to hell-fire are metaphors or imageries God employed
to communicate to an immature people: "The people God was addressing in Biblical times did
not always understand this cause-effect principle [of the power-source/lamp analogy]. It was
difficult for them to appreciate the destructiveness of being out of harmony with God. And so
the Bible writers employed the imagery of consuming flames to describe the sureness and
completeness of the destruction of life apart from God. But being apart from God is in itself
the worst thing that could ever happen to a person. God doesn't need to torch hellish fires to
enhance what is already so terrible."19
In summary, the liberal reinterpretation of progressive revelation is the hermeneutical
foundation undergirding attempts by some Adventists to view God as One who is ever
changing, does not know the future absolutely, would not visit retribution on sinners, and
consequently, could not have given His Son to die as the sinners' substitutionary atonement.
In this "mature" view of God, hell-fire is often reinterpreted as merely an intense mental
anguish and remorse experienced by sinners when they are ultimately disconnected from God.
But liberalism's theory of progressive revelation also underlies recent reinterpretations of the
Adventist view of "present truth" and "new light."
"Progressive" Scholars and "Present Truth." A widely circulated document by an
influential North American Conference endorsing women's ordination redefines the ideas of
"progressive revelation" and "present truth":
"The essential presupposition of the idea of 'the great controversy' is that God is active
throughout history, bringing new truths to light. Historically, Adventists have understood that
God is active in our own time, using the term 'present truth' to denote truths which were not
present in earlier times, but which God has led his people to discover. Further, there is the
parallel idea of 'progressive revelation,' which suggests that God has not revealed all truth at
some previous time, that revelation is not confined to the thought and behavior patterns of the
prophets and disciples of old, but that God lives and is active today and tomorrow. Most
importantly, this dynamic character of truth is the undergirding theological rationale for the
very existence of Seventh-day Adventism. Thus the notion of Scriptural literalism is
essentially un-Adventist."20
Contrary to what Adventists have always believed, "present truth" is here defined along
historical-critical lines as "truths that were not present in earlier times,"--i.e., "the prophets
and disciples of old" were not privileged to have the "new light" that our twentieth century
progressive culture needs. In this way truth is seen as "dynamic." In other words, God
by-passed Peter, James, John, Paul, and Ellen White, in order to reveal to the "progressive
Adventist" scholars "present truths" which we cannot evaluate by prior revelation in the
"prophets and disciples of old." Then how can one "prove all things" and "hold fast that which
is good" (1 Thess 5:21)? How does one "try the spirits whether they are of God" (1 John
4:1)?21
The above view of progressive revelation and present truth finds expression in an article
entitled "Equality Is Present Truth." In this work, the editors of Adventist Today also explain
119
that in "present truth" "God reveals new concepts of truth not known previously."22
If "present truth" is a revelation of truth "not known previously," and if "equality is present
truth," does it mean that the inspired Bible writers did not each the concept of equality? Or is
it more accurate to say that while they had much to say about true equality, they did not teach
the kind of equality being advanced today by "progressive" scholars?23
This liberal reinterpretation of "present truth" to mean "dynamic truth" not contained in
Scripture is the foundation upon which some want to construct an Adventist theology for the
next millennium. For example, at a recent meeting of the Association of Adventist Forums
("an organization concerned with the reform of Adventism and the creation of progressive
community within the church"24), one systematic theologian stated: "My first proposal is that
we revitalize our theology. In order to do this, we need to recover the idea of 'present
truth'--truth that is not closed but open, not changeless but dynamic."25
What scholars of "dynamic truth" apparently overlook is the contradictory logic inherent in
their assertion that truth is "not changeless." For if truth is not changeless, then the
"progressive" scholar's own statement that truth "is not closed but open, not changeless but
dynamic" is itself not a changeless truth! Why should we accept as "truth" what is not a
changeless truth? Which theology needs "revitalizing"--Adventism's historic theology which
is based on the solid Rock of absolute truth, or historical-critical theology which is
established on the shifting sand of "dynamic" truth? Against these contemporary
reinterpretations, we must assert that truth is an unchanging reality, for God is truth, and He
does not change; His Word is truth, and it does not change.
Revision of Ellen White's View. Another author argues for a dynamic concept of "present
truth" by claiming that even the early Adventist pioneers, including Ellen White, did not
believe that truth was static.26 As is often the case in such efforts to revise the interpretation of
Adventist history, one fails to find support in the Ellen White sources the author cites!
Contrary to the impression the author creates, Ellen White did not state that what was present
truth a hundred years ago might not be present truth today.
What she actually wrote is this: "The present truth, which is a test to the people of this
generation, was not a test to the people of generations far back" (Testimonies for the Church,
2:693). The point is not that truth in this generation was not truth in an earlier generation. Her
emphasis was on testing truth. Each generation, each time, has its testing truth. But it is the
same old truth of Scripture forcefully brought to bear on an individual or group at a particular
time and place, testing their loyalty or faithfulness to the God who has beamed His
searchlight on an old truth.
As one Bible-believing scholar correctly noted, "To say, then, that something is 'present
truth' should not imply that what is truth today was not truth in previous generations. Rather,
truth that Scripture taught but which had been overlooked or forgotten now shines with new
luster. When this happens, God does not condemn the previous generations. 'The times of this
ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent' (Acts
17:30)."27 However, this "present truth" never contradicts an old truth, despite what scholars
often suggest who argue for a dynamic concept of present truth (cf. Selected Messages,
1:161-162; Review and Herald, June 29, 1886, par. 9).
A Bible-Believing Adventist Response
The Bible teaches: "To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this
word, it is because there is no light n them" (Isa 8:20). Even the three angels' messages were
considered "present truth" only because they were an aspect of "the everlasting gospel." They
120
were not brand new truths without a basis in prior biblical revelation. They were not the
product of an anti-Catholic nineteenth-century culture.
If "present truth" were an evolving, "progressive," or "dynamic" truth, it would follow
logically that other Christian doctrines may also be evolving. Adventists would therefore be
justified in challenging the church's long-held teaching on sexual morality, homosexuality,
divorce and remarriage, clean and unclean foods, use of alcohol, wearing of jewelry, the
concept of the remnant, and other matters, as some are already doing. In all these cases the
liberal concept of "progressive revelation" assumes that truth is relative; the cases differ only
in degree of application.
Ellen White discredits the claims of the revisionist proponents of "present truth" or
"progressive revelation." Anticipating the modern reinterpretations and applications of
Scripture which contradict Scripture, she wrote: "When the power of God testifies as to what
is truth, that truth is to stand forever as the truth. No after suppositions contrary to the light
God has given are to be entertained. Men will arise with interpretations of Scripture which are
to them truth, but which are not truth. The truth for this time God has given us as a foundation
for our faith. One will arise, and still another, with new light, which contradicts the light that
God has given under the demonstration of His Holy Spirit. . . . We are not to receive the
words of those who come with a message that contradicts the special points of our faith"
(Selected Messages, 1:161).
If accepted, the new view of "progressive revelation" will result in pluralism in doctrine,
lifestyle, and interpretation. Everyone will claim a right to his or her "new light" (the new
expressions are "unity in diversity" or "openness to other people's ideas").
One church administrator has already endorsed such an outcome in print: "If we truly
believe in the notion of progressive revelation (as claimed by the preamble of the Statement
of Fundamental Beliefs), we will allow tensions in our belief system as we continue to grow in
an understanding of God. If we are on a spiritual journey together, we will create room for
diversity of thought and opinion, perhaps even interpretation."28 In other words, "progressive
revelation" should allow for pluralism in belief and interpretation.
To accept a system of multiple interpretations (hermeneutical pluralism) requires one to
assume that there is no underlying unity or harmony in Scripture, that Scripture can be
interpreted in many different yet equally truthful ways. Is this not a recipe for theological
pluralism, which breeds uncertainty of faith and relativism in ethics? Should Seventh-day
Adventists really go this way, even claiming that the Holy Spirit is an ally to this?
For Ellen White, the answer is very simple: "The Spirit was not given--nor can it ever be
bestowed--to supersede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the word of God is
the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested" (The Great Controversy, p.
vii). Again, "The old truths are essential; new truth is not independent of the old, but an
unfolding of it. It is only as the old truths are understood that we can comprehend the new"
(Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 127-128). "In all His teachings He [Christ] dwelt upon the
unchangeable positions of Bible truth" (The Upward Look, p. 313, emphasis supplied).

5. Dismissing Bible-believing Adventism "for its 'proof text' approach to Scripture, and
its uncompromising emphasis on 'correct doctrine' or 'objective truth'," Daily asserts: "Jesus
Himself was not the author of a static written code [a body of objective doctrines]. His
revelation of truth was a dynamic, living revelation" (ibid., pp. 36, 47).
6. The four categories of prohibited things correspond to the instructions Moses gave in
Leviticus 17 and 18, which include reference not only to the Israelites but to the "strangers
which sojourn among you" (17:8, 10, 12, 13, 15; 18:26). In the letter that went out to the
churches, these items are even listed in the same order as they appear in Leviticus (see Acts
15:29). That the council did not require circumcision of the Gentiles seems to indicate a
recognition that this sign was given to the Israelites but not to the "strangers which sojourn
among you," unless they should choose to become Jews. The Jerusalem Council ruled, in
effect, that Gentiles did not have to become Jews in order to be Christians and experience
Jesus' salvation. As with matters of the ceremonial law, circumcision was not to be expected
of the Gentile Christians. Paul himself made the Christian perspective explicit: "Circumcision
is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts" (1 Cor
7:19 NIV).
7. See Andrew Bates (pseudonym), "The Jerusalem Council: A Model for Utrecht?"
Ministry, April 1995, pp. 18-23; cf. Alden Thompson, Inspiration: Hard Questions, Honest
Answers (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald, 1991), pp. 149-150. Thompson writes: "At
least one culturally conditioned requirement of Acts 15, food offered to idols, was already in
the process of being set aside, even while the brethren voted on it" (ibid., p. 149). For a
response to the above interpretation of the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15, see our Searching
the Scriptures (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Adventists Affirm Publications, 1995), pp. 42-44.
8. A careful study of chapters 8-10 of 1 Corinthians will reveal that Paul did not violate
the council's decision. Paul addressed three issues regarding food offered to idols: (a) Could
Christians accept invitations from their friends and relatives to eat these foods in pagan
temples? (b) Could they buy such food if it was sold in the market? and (c) If the food was
brought home, was it all right to eat it? Paul answered that: (i) Christians could not go to
pagan temples and eat these foods (1 Cor 8:10; cf. 10:19-21); (ii) they could buy these foods
in the market--unless it violated the consciences of those who called attention to it (1 Cor
10:27-33); (iii) they could eat the foods in their homes, since idols were really nothing (1 Cor
10:25-26; cf. 8:1ff.). Eating the foods at the temple was incompatible with Christianity, since
it implied worship of those gods. This seems to be the thrust of the Jerusalem Council's decree
(cf. Rev 2:14, 20; see also Lev 17:7; 18:24-30). Likewise, if others might construe that
homage was being offered to the gods, the Christian should not buy the foods in the market.
At home, where worship was not implied, eating the foods woud compromise neither
conscience nor witness. Thus, Paul did not contravene the prohibitions of the Jerusalem
council decision, but rather established a theological explanation of the spirit behind the
decision (1 Cor 8-10) and how Christians should implement it, balancing freedom and
responsibility (1 Cor 8:9, and following through ch. 9).

23. Observe that Bible-believing students uphold the biblical teaching on ontological
equality, which suggests that human beings are equal in their standing before God, in that
123
they were all created in His image, they all need salvation through Christ, and they all have
been called to the same destiny (Gen 1:26, 27; Gal 3:28; 1 Pet 3:7). Ontological equality
refers solely to God's action and purposes, and not to any intrinsic qualities that human beings
possess by themselves; it is a gift of God to every member of the human race--regardless of
ethnicity, status or gender. This is what Paul had in mind when he wrote in Galatians 3:28 that
"in Christ Jesus," there is "neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave or free, neither male nor
female." This statement on ontological equality did not, however, do away with functional
role distinctions. Thus, ontological equality must not be confused with functional
equality--the view that there is equality of ability, skill, gifts, office or position. The Bible
does not teach functional equality, since the Holy Spirit gives to each "severally as He wills"
(cf. 1 Cor 12; Rom 12: 3-8). This understanding will correct some of the excesses of the

DEPARTING FROM THE WORD
PART V
The Bible – “Literal” or “Principle” Approach?
Objective. In this section we shall investigate the extent to which higher-critical
assumptions are influencing Seventh-day Adventist views regarding the validity of the Ten
Commandments, the Sabbath, end-time prophecy, Jesus' second coming, the sanctuary
doctrine, the substitutionary atonement of Christ, and issues dealing with Adventist lifestyle.
Key Issue. How should we interpret the Bible--with a "literal" or a "principle" approach?
Traditional Adventist Belief. Seventh-day Adventists have always maintained that one
finds the true meaning of Scripture by seeking the plain, obvious sense of the text.
Interpreting Scripture literally does not mean blind, rigid literalism. Literal interpretation
means we understand a given passage in its natural or normal sense. We must understand the
words just as we would interpret the language of normal discourse.
From the literal meaning of the biblical text, we can derive appropriate principles for
today's living. These principles must be faithful to the literal meaning and must not contradict
any established biblical teaching or truth. The details of the traditional Adventist approach to
interpretation are described in "Methods of Bible Study" (see Appendix C).
Theological Assumption. The theological assumption behind interpretation based on the
plain literal meaning of Scripture is this: though the Bible's content is profound, it came from
a perfect Communicator. God has done what all good communicators do--He has spoken in
the language of the listener. God has used the expressions of normal people, however
imperfect, so that "the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein" (Isa 35:8).
Rather than speaking in grand superhuman language, "The Lord speaks to human beings in
imperfect speech, in order that the degenerate senses, the dull, earthly perception, of earthly
beings may comprehend His words. Thus is shown God's condescension. He meets fallen
human beings where they are. . . . Instead of the expressions of the Bible being exaggerated,
as many people suppose, the strong expressions break down before the magnificence of the
thought, though the penmen selected the most expressive language" (Selected Messages,
1:22).
"The Bible is not given to us in grand superhuman language. Jesus, in order to reach man
where he is, took humanity. The Bible must be given in the language of men. Everything that
is human is imperfect. Different meanings are expressed by the same word; there is not one
word for each distinct idea" (ibid., 1:20). God's use of "imperfect" human language to
communicate does not mean that the truthfulness of Scripture's message is compromised.
Rather, it simply means that "infinite ideas cannot be perfectly embodied in finite vehicles of
thought" (ibid., 1:22). In their attempt to communicate infinite ideas in finite human language,
the inspired writers sometimes employed figures of speech, like parables, hyperbole, simile,
metaphor, and symbolism. But even this figurative language conveys clear, literal truth.
Literal Understanding. Thus, apocalyptic books like Daniel, Zechariah, Ezekiel, and
Revelation, which employ figures and symbols, must be studied carefully to discover the
literal truth they convey. The same applies to the parables. They are stories used to illustrate
125
spiritual truth. Though the details regarding people, events, times, and places in the parables
may not be actually historical, the spiritual truths they convey are always literal and real.
Literal interpretation, therefore, means first understanding Scripture in its plain, normal
sense. The interpreter then proceeds to apply the literal meaning to the contemporary situation
of the interpreter. Those who reject literal interpretation have no objective control for wild
imaginations, no safeguard against fanciful spiritualizing, allegorizing, and relativizing
biblical truth. This is why responsible Bible students insist that the "principle" of application
must always be controlled by the literal, plain reading of the text. Otherwise we tend to pick
and choose only the supposed principles of the Bible palatable to our taste.1
When liberalism relativizes Scripture, it uses the Bible selectively, choosing a "key point,"
"central concept," or "principle" in Scripture by means of which it decides what is abiding or
relevant in the Bible. In other words, the new views of Scripture seek to establish a "canon
within the biblical Canon" (i.e., an inspiring booklet within the inspired Book). Without the
literal reading of the biblical text, they spiritualize away, through fanciful interpretations, the
plain meaning of the Scriptures.
How are historical-critical assumptions on these matters affecting the Adventist church?
Effect of the Liberal Approach
To justify setting aside the plain, literal reading of Scripture, expressions like these are
now being used: "trajectory of Scripture," the "flow of Scripture," the "plot of Scripture,"
"Scripture as a whole" (not "the whole Scripture"), "the primary emphasis" of Scripture, "the
positive principles" of Scripture, etc. In any case, it is the interpreter who decides what is the
central concept which controls the selection process. Those who adopt these approaches to
Scripture reinterpret the Bible and make applications of Scripture that lead away from
established truths.
"Positive Principle." For example, one Adventist Old Testament scholar develops a
three-tier "law pyramid" which places the principle of love at the apex of the pyramid as the
highest norm. Below it are the two laws--love to God and love to neighbor, and at the bottom
is the Ten Commandments. His pyramid then consists of "The one, the two, and the ten." He
writes: "A key principle undergirds the concept of law pyramid: some of God's laws are more
important than others."2
But how do we know which of God's laws are more important than others? He explains:
"The key point [of the casebook approach] is that the positive principles embedded in the one,
the two, and the ten are absolute and enduring, but the specific applications are not."3 None of
the Ten Commandments, then, is absolute or enduring, but only the "positive principles"
found in them. Adopting this kind of methodology, each student of the Bible could decide for
himself what constitutes those "positive principles."4
Sabbath "Principle." What happens when one interprets Scripture according to the
"positive principle" approach? The Worldwide Church of God, publisher of the Plain Truth
magazine and until recently a Sabbath-keeping church, has given up its historic teaching on
the validity of the seventh-day Sabbath. The reason may be of interest to Adventists tempted
to look only for the "positive principles" within the Ten Commandments.
Under the influence of well-educated moderate liberal scholars, the leaders of the
Worldwide Church of God came to believe that the "seventh-day" component of the fourth
commandment is not as relevant as the "positive principle" of the Sabbath commandment.
They argue on the basis of their "New Covenant" theology that observing the Sabbath on the
126
seventh day is no longer as important as the "principle" of observing a day of rest after six
days of labor; the Sabbath can be any day.5
Among Seventh-day Adventists, the historic method of interpreting Scripture--what
historical-critical scholars refer to as the "literal-based approach"--insists that the
"seventh-day" (Saturday) is to be observed as the Sabbath. The "principle-based approach,"
however, may eventually lead to the "positive principle" of the Sabbath--one day of rest in
seven, as has happened in the Worldwide Church of God, and as is being advocated by two
former Adventists, a pastor and a Bible scholar.6
With such an approach, the Sabbath/Sunday issue raised in Daniel, Revelation, and The
Great Controversy becomes obsolete for today's anti-apocalyptic culture. Our claim to be the
"remnant" becomes mere triumphalism and, hence, our opposition to joining the ecumenical
movement is nothing more than religious bigotry or intolerance. This point will become
clearer in part six of this chapter when we take a look at a proposal being suggested as an
"Adventism for a New Generation."
Apocalyptic Prophecy. Already, one scholar and church administrator has called for "a
fresh approach" to our understanding of end-time prophecy as a means to overcome the
increasing theological pluralism in the church. He argues mistakenly that the "general
anti-Catholic climate which prevailed in the United States in the 1830s through the 1850s"
and the "uncritical adoption" of "William Miller's hermeneutical method in dealing with
apocalyptic Bible prophecy" were the reasons behind Adventism's understanding of last-day
events.
He expresses his discomfort with the "more conservative Adventists [who] insist that
Adventism must continue to subscribe to its traditional interpretations of prophecy, with the
corresponding condemnation of Roman Catholicism and other Christian churches." Against
these conservative Adventists who "insist that 'the old landmarks' of the Adventist faith must
be zealously guarded and are unwilling to re-think or modify traditional views," he sides with
the "more 'progressively' inclined [who] are increasingly open to emphasizing the common
bond with other Christians and [who] tend to feel uncomfortable with traditional attitudes." In
his opinion the way to make Adventism "more relevant to this generation" is to adopt a "fresh
approach that will re-evaluate the traditional Adventist views in the context of time."7
Thus, a growing body of Adventist scholars are saying: "We must become facilitators of
'spiritual ecumenicity' [of the charismatic movement] (as opposed to institutional ecumenicity
[of the World Council of Churches]), so that we can respond to Christ's last prayer for unity
(John 17:21) by breaking down the barriers of denominationalism rather than helping to build
them up. . . . We must open ourselves to the possibility of new and different eschatological
[end-time] scenarios so that we do not enter the twenty-first century with a nineteenth-century
view of prophecy."8
Spiritual Second Coming Principle. Observe that if one's "fresh approach" to Scripture
follows some ambiguous "positive principle" method, there are several ways in which one can
"re-think" or "modify" Adventist doctrine. For example, a former book editor of one of our
church's publishing houses has identified "the 'spiritual Second Coming' principle" (as he calls
the real "principle" behind the Bible's "literal" teaching of a second Advent) as the belief that
"Jesus has come in your hearts."
He continues: "The Second Coming can be accepted as symbolic or typical of the
consummation of your religious experience, an event judging and justifying your spiritual
connection ith God. You may or may not choose to deal with the question of literality [the
literal-based approach?]. But in spite of everything, you can maintain your spiritual existence,
127
which I submit, is far more vital than settling any questions of literality! . . . Once the
principle of symbolic interpretation is accepted, one can see many Second Comings."9
The "spiritual Second Coming principle" that leads one to see "many Second Comings" in
Scripture is the same approach that undergirds the "apotelesmatic principle" (multiple
fulfillment principle) or "idealist" principle of interpretation of Desmond Ford, the
Seventh-day Adventist scholar who in the 1970s and 1980s departed from our historic
teaching on the sanctuary doctrine, prophetic interpretation, and the Spirit of Prophecy.10
Clearly, the so-called "principle-based approach," which may be another name for the
historical-critical method, does indeed affect the interpretation of Bible prophecy. Against the
literal or plain reading of the Bible, this liberal way of studying the Bible seeks the "positive
principle" of the Scripture. It is a sophisticated way to spiritualize away the apocalyptic
prophecies of Daniel and Revelation and their interpretations as found in The Great
Controversy.
This explains why the Rio document, "Methods of Bible Study," stated that "The
historical-critical method minimizes the need for faith in God and obedience to His
commandments. In addition, because such a method de-emphasizes the divine element in the
Bible as an inspired book (including its resultant unity) and depreciates or misunderstands
apocalyptic prophecy and the eschatological portions of the Bible, we urge Adventist Bible
students to avoid relying on the use of the presuppositions and the resultant deductions
associated with the historical-critical method."11 Regrettably, as we have seen, many
Adventist scholars still use the historical-critical method--disguised under different labels.
The Sanctuary Doctrine. According to the former book editor mentioned above, the
Adventist critics' suggestion that the sanctuary doctrine is "seriously flawed" is "an
understatement!" He writes: "Fashioned not to save souls, but to save our collective, wounded
ego in the wake of a 'great disappointment' (as though God could be guilty of 'standing us
up'!), it [the sanctuary doctrine] is actually destructive to the individual soul."12 He cites
another writer to explain his own attitude toward the sanctuary doctrine: "Discard the
damaging. And shop elsewhere to meet unfulfilled needs."13 The unwritten "principle" to
rehabilitate the sanctuary doctrine, if it is possible at all, is "the fulfilment of needs."
If the statement of a former associate editor of the Review and Herald and current editor of
Adventist Today is anything to go by, then a significant number of scholars and church
administrators, including himself, seek to revise our traditional Sanctuary doctrine (Article 23
of our Fundamental Beliefs).14 It is understandable that he would take exception to this
fundamental pillar of our faith, given his favorable disposition towards the historical-critical
method.15
Among those who are seeking to revise the traditional sanctuary doctrine is a theology
professor. Seeking to move beyond the "maddening literalization of the rituals of Leviticus"
and "cabalistic numerology" (1844?), he builds upon a non-Adventist's work and intimates
that we must "re-vision" our historic sanctuary doctrine around a socio-political axis.
Believing that his approach will make the sanctuary doctrine "relevant," he suggests that
God's "presence" in the sanctuary (Lev 26:11) should be understood as His presence in the
church on earth; the "defilement" of the sanctuary (Lev 26:31) should be understood as God's
forced withdrawal, occasioned by physical and moral pollution of the earth (oil spills, acid
rain, ozone depletion, nuclear waste, killing of innocent people in wars, starvation, etc.); the
"restoration" (Lev 26:42ff.) means that the church should become a place for the "hurting, the
marginalized, the disappointed," a refuge where people can "openly express anger and fear
and doubt, an even heresy--otherwise the church will always remain a court of law rather than
a place of safety."16
128
Does one need to go "beyond literalization" in order to affirm these relevant issues of
social ethics?
The Substitutionary Atonement of Christ. For one Adventist theologian and college
administrator, the "principle" in Christ's atonement is "social justice." On the basis of this
"principle," he denies the penal substitutionary atonement of Christ, the teaching that Jesus
Christ died in our stead, taking upon Himself the penalty of death that we deserved. The titles
of his two articles summarize his views: "God's Justice, Yes; Penal Substitution, No"; ". . .
Penal Substitutionary Atonement is Still Unbiblical."17
Notice that the above author's "principle" of "justice" essentially repudiates the historic
Adventist understanding of Christ's atonement as stated in our Fundamental Beliefs, No. 9
and beautifully captured by Ellen White: "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be
treated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we
might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the death
which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. 'With His stripes we are
healed'" (The Desire of Ages, p. 25).
Sad to say, another influential Adventist theologian rejects this substitutionary atonement
of Christ on the grounds that if we are saved because of Christ's death, it would in principle
be salvation by works--Christ's works!18 The author of the devotional book, His Healing
Love, echoes this sentiment when he asks rhetorically: "Who needs Christ's merits?"19
Adventist Lifestyle. Traditional Adventist practices like abstinence from the use of
unclean foods, jewelry, and alcohol are also coming under fire as the "principle" approach
gains acceptance in the church. Thus, a growing number of Adventist scholars are asking,
"What's the big deal about these lifestyle issues?" To such, pork and jewelry are not biblical
mandates, but rather are, at best, sociological symbols that our nineteenth-century colonial
Adventists instituted as "markers" to identify those who belong to their faith.20 Even on the
question of whether the Bible condemns alcohol use or its abuse, some suggest that the
answer depends heavily on one's present "bias."21
1. Clean and Unclean. Since some Adventist scholars believe that there is no clear
scriptural mandate for our lifestyle practices, we should observe how their own "positive
principle" conditions their interpretation of Scripture on these issues. One Adventist scholar
asks: "Should Adventists use Leviticus 11 to support the prohibition of pork and other foods
listed there as 'unclean'?" He answers No. In his opinion, "only a penchant for proof texting"
will lead one to continue upholding the clean/unclean distinction. Arguing on the basis of a
"more principled biblical-theological foundation" rather than on "dubious proof-texts," he
concludes that Adventists "will refrain from eating pork, not because the laws concerning
clean and unclean in Leviticus are still binding on Christians," but because "pork is especially
unhealthful."22
The author of Inspiration echoes the same "principle" approach to Scriptures. Since the
"principle" against eating unclean animals (Lev 11; Deut 14) is believed to be "health," he
suggests that when threatened by starvation, one could "eat everything possible to enhance
and preserve life."23 Did the Bible cite "health" as the reason for prohibiting unclean animals
for food, so that if one could raise pigs, snakes, lizards, earthworms, cockroaches, or vultures
in a sanitized environment, their carcasses would be "clean" for food? Did not God give His
own reason for designating some animals as unfit for food (cf. Deut 14:2, 3)?
2. Jewelry. The new method of interpretation is also shaping the way we relate to the
jewelry issue. This is best illustrated by calling attention to the revealing conclusion of an
article titled, "Thinking About Jewelry: What the Bible (Really) Says," written by the editor
129
of the recentbook, Shall We Dance. "If you utilize key-text hermeneutics to study the issue of
jewelry, you can develop a good biblical case against wearing it. If you employ contextual
hermeneutics, the case against it is less compelling. If you're a Seventh-day Adventist, you
probably hold the Bible as the final authority for truth. Some have suggested that if your
training in Seventh-day Adventism pre-dates 1970, you're likely [to] prefer key-text
hermeneutics. If your higher education dates after 1970, you probably prefer contextual
hermeneutics. When it comes to jewelry, it's not a matter of whether or not you follow the
Bible; it's often more a matter of the way you use the Bible to establish your standards."24
It appears that the "key-text" designation is a new way of saying "proof-text" method, a
label mistakenly applied to those who still uphold the long-standing Seventh-day Adventist
plain meaning of Scripture. According to the article's author, among those who employ the
"key-text" method are: (a) "those opposed to the ordination of women at the General
Conference session in 1995"; (b) the publishers of Bible Readings for the Home (Review and
Herald, 1914, 1935, 1942, 1958, 1963); and (c) "a number of the biblical writers"--notably,
the apostle Paul: "It appears Paul used Old Testament verses out of context on occasion as he
wrote in the New Testament!"25
It is, at least, encouraging that the apostle Paul is bracketed among those who employ the
"key-text" method. Could it be that those who use this "pre-1970" approach are on more solid
ground than the practitioners of the post-1970 "contextual" approach, the historical-critical
method? The choice for Adventists is really between the approach marked out by the ancient
Bible writers and that employed by the so-called "post-1970" scholars. In any case, only on
the basis of the "positive principles" of the latter approach can one endorse the use of jewelry.
3. Other Issues. For pro-abortionists, the "principle" of selectivity is "choice," understood
to be the right to terminate a pregnancy, even if the baby's choice is denied.26 For biblical
feminists, the "principle" is "equality," defined as the absence of role differentiation between
men and women in both the home and the church.27 For libertarians or situation ethicists, the
"principle" is "love," even if it includes such things as divorce and remarriage on non-biblical
grounds, breaking the Sabbath, cheating, stealing, lying, discriminating against other races,
pre- and extra-marital sex--as long as these things are done for "loving" reasons.28 And for
those sympathetic to homosexual theology, the "principle" may be "acceptance" and
"compassion."29
Deriving the "Positive Principle." How can one decide which "principle" applies? The
author of Inspiration suggested that "reason in dialogue with the Spirit, determines which of
those cases [in Scripture] are most helpful in informing the decisions we make day by day."30
Instead of submitting to God's Word, human reason engages in a "dialogue" with the Spirit.
The author makes this point more explicit, stating that in his "casebook approach" to biblical
interpretation he will "never take an inspired writer to be a final interpreter of a passage
written by another inspired writer," and that he will accept inspired interpretations as valid
only when they are in harmony with his own scholarly "rules" of interpretation.31 Apparently,
today's scholar is more apostolic than the apostles!
A professor of history in an Adventist university takes up this point in connection with
issues raised by Inspiration: "I don't think it is possible for us to totally subject human
reasoning to the higher authority of the Bible. We are, after all, humans."32 Instead of
submitting to Scripture, proponents of the historical-critical method want to "dialogue" with
Scripture. However, when they find its message unpalatable, they quarrel with Scripture and
criticize it. But the prophet Isaiah declares: "Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker" (Isa
45:9 NIV; cf. Rom 9:20-21).
130
A Bible-Believing Adventist Response
The "principle-based approach" is a sophisticated attempt to relativize the Bible. It is a
form of situation ethics--the ethical system that says rightness or wrongness is determined by
what is "loving"--designed for those who consider themselves "mature" Christians. Notice
how the author of Inspiration contrasts his "casebook approach" with the "codebook"
approach (what some today would call the "literal-based approach"):
"Admittedly, what I have outlined is a sophisticated approach to the law, one that requires
a rather advanced level of mental and Christian maturity. We would not expect young
children or new Christians to be able to function at that level. For that very reason, God has
given rules and adaptations--codebook, if you please, for those who need them. And the
church, as a body of Christ, responsible for believers of every shape and capability, will
always have a list of rules to get us started, so to speak."33 Observe how similar the above
"casebook approach" is to the "principle-based approach"--requiring "a high level of abstract
thinking" believed to be favored by those who live in regions where the church has "matured
for a century and half."34
Principles Dependent on Literal Meaning. It appears that the "principle-based approach"
is a subtle way of finding fault with the Bible by allowing human reason to be the ultimate
judge. But a true understanding of biblical principles does not create its own artificial
"principles"; rather, it is based on a literal understanding of the Bible, ascertained by carefully
using the literary, grammatical, and historical information contained in the Bible itself,
consistent with Scripture's nature as fully inspired, trustworthy, and authoritative. The true
Seventh-day Adventist method is a principled approach to the literal meaning of the text.
Illumined Rationality, Not Perverted Rationalism. The Bible teaches that because of the
basic difference between God and human beings (i.e., because God is so much greater than
we are), and because of the problems of sin and the unwillingness of unconverted human
reason to surrender to God, there are limits to reason (Isa 55:8, 9; Rom 11:33; 2 Cor 4:4; 1
Cor 2:14). The greatest mind, unless guided by the Word of God, becomes bewildered;
human rationality will become perverted into rationalism. The Bible's prescription for
autonomous human reason is conversion, renewing the mind and transforming it into
conformity with His will (Rom 12:2). When this happens, Spirit-regenerated human reason
delights to submit totally to the higher authority of the Bible.
Against those who contradict established Bible truths by their re-interpretations and
re-applications of Scripture, Ellen White wrote: "We are not to receive the words of those
who come with a message that contradicts the special points of our faith. They gather together
a mass of Scripture, and pile it as proof around their asserted theories. This has been done
over and over again during the past fifty years. And while the Scriptures are God's word, and
are to be respected, the application of them, if such application moves one pillar from the
foundation that God has sustained these fifty years, is a great mistake. He who makes such
application knows not the wonderful demonstration of the Holy Spirit that gave power and
force to the past messages that have come to the people of God" (Selected Messages, 1:161).
God Never Contradicts Himself. If a scholar arises with an interpretation of Scripture,
even one disguised as new light from a "principled-approach," and it contradicts the
established truths of our faith, we are urged: "We must be decidedon this subject; for the
points that he is trying to prove by Scripture are not sound. They do not prove that the past
experience of God's people was a fallacy. We had the truth; we were directed by the angels of
131
God. It was under the guidance of the Holy Spirit that the presentation of the sanctuary
question was given. It is eloquence for every one to keep silent in regard to the features of our
faith in which they acted no part. God never contradicts Himself. Scripture proofs are
misapplied if forced to testify to that which is not true. Another and still another will arise and
bring in supposedly great light, and make their assertions. But we stand by the old landmarks"
(Selected Messages, 1:161-162, emphasis supplied).
At a time when "to many the Bible is as a lamp without oil, because they have turned their
minds into channels of speculative belief that bring misunderstanding and confusion," and at a
time when "the work of higher criticism, in dissecting, conjecturing, reconstructing, is
destroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation . . . robbing God's word of power to
control, uplift, and inspire human lives" (The Acts of the Apostles, p. 474), Bible-believing
Adventists must affirm with Ellen White: "Reason must acknowledge an authority superior to
itself. Heart and intellect must bow to the Great I AM" (The Ministry of Healing, p. 438). In
studying the Scriptures, reason must be humble enough to accept and obey what it finds in
those sacred pages and must not seek to circumvent biblical teaching by resorting to abstract
"positive principles."

former Adventist professor of theology has given up on the seventh-day Sabbath and now
pastors the First Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The influence of the historical-critical
method on this Bible scholar's view of the Bible Sabbath is evident in his recent article
arguing that "diversity" in the New Testament allows for "at least three views of the Sabbath,
all of which may claim roots in the primitive church" (see Jerry Gladson, "The Sabbath in
Christian Life: A Reconsideration," Adventist Today, July August 1996, p 16). Gladson's

day prophecy of Daniel 8:14 ended in 1844 (see Cottrell, "A Guide to Reliable
Interpretation," The Welcome Table, pp. 74-75). The front cover of the defunct Adventist
Currents (October 1983) places Cottrell's picture alongside "some of the Seventh-day
Adventist leaders who either doubted or discarded the traditional teaching of the sanctuary: O.
R. L. Crosier, D. M. Canright, E. J. Waggoner, A. F. Ballenger, J. H. Kellogg, A. T. Jones, L.

15. In recent times Cottrell has called his method "the historical method," arguing that "no
Adventist Bible scholar subscribes to that [historical-critical] method, or to its presuppositions
133
or conclusions" (see his article in The Welcome Table, pp. 79, 84, 80). This contradicts his
earlier assertion that, with the exception of "all but a few," the historical-critical method is the
method that had been employed by Adventist scholars since the 1930s. Evidence of his own
historical-critical leanings can be found in his "Blame It On Rio: The Annual Council
Statement on Methods of Bible Study," Adventist Currents, March 1987, p. 33. For a detailed

salvation, but a rejection of the merit-earning formula itself" (ibid.). His theory of atonement
is a version of the moral influence theory advocated by Peter Abelard (1079-1142). This view
says that Jesus' death did not pay the legal debt of our sins, but rather it was simply a
demonstration of God's love designed to awaken a response in us (ibid., pp. 20, 95); cf.

DEPARTING FROM THE WORD
PART VI
Adventism for a New Generation – Perception or Deception?
Objective. In this section we shall draw out the implications of our discussion in the
previous sections of this lengthy chapter, examining a recent proposal for an "Adventism for a
New Generation."
Key Issue. What do the new approaches to Scripture imply for the life, mission, and
identity of the church? What kind of Adventism do the new approaches to Scripture produce?
How does this relate to the perceived polarization between "the church of the West" and "the
rest of the church"? Is the reading of Scripture through higher-critical lenses evidence of true
insight and clear perception or an omen of blindness and deception?
Introduction. Because many Bible scholars in Seventh-day Adventist institutions around
the world are still faithfully employing traditional Adventism's plain reading of Scripture,
they continue to uphold the biblical doctrines and practices of our faith. However, since at
least in first-world countries a significant majority have embraced aspects of the
higher-critical method, we need to know the destination of that approach to Scriptures. This
chapter was designed to illustrate the need to "examine the full consequences of our
theological method lest we prove more than we intend."1
In the course of our investigation, we have shown how wrong assumptions regarding the
inspiration, trustworthiness, and the sole authority of Scripture result in departing from the
Word and consequently from our distinctive Bible doctrines (e.g., the Sabbath, the sanctuary,
atonement of Christ, second coming, spirit of prophecy, remnant, etc.). They also affect our
views on issues of Christian lifestyle: abortion, polygamy, women's ordination,
homosexuality, dress, clean food, jewelry, use of alcoholic beverages, war, etc.
What does this new trend mean for the identity and mission of the church? Will such
published calls as we have examined here from various thought-leaders bring about a
reformation in the church? Or do they lead away from what we have always known as the
Seventh-day Adventist faith? What kind of Adventism is being created for our new
generation?
The Need for Revival and Reformation. Many earnest Seventh-day Adventists,
especially young people who have grown up in the church, feel increasingly disenchanted and
disillusioned. They have observed that while we rightly affirm "the Bible and the Bible only,"
many of us do not have a living experience with the Bible's divine Author. Baptism seems
more a graduation ceremony rather than the start of a new life in Christ. Our identity as God's
"remnant" church makes us complacent instead of inspiring us to fulfill our divine mission to
the world. We assert repeatedly that "we have the truth," but very often the truth does not
have us. Our preaching, teaching, and evangelism may cram the mind with information but
seldom bring about the deep soul searching and humility of heart that results in transforming
the character. Our ethical positions on social issues eflect pragmatic concerns rather than
fidelity to Scripture. And instead of our worship being reverently vibrant, it tends to be either
dull and sterile or emotional and superficial.
The church's condition has led today's generation of Adventists to renew the call for a
revival of primitive godliness. But while both mainstream and liberal Adventism correctly
137
recognize this need for revival and reformation, the two theological camps offer totally
different solutions to the problem.
Mainstream, Bible-believing Adventists hold that wherever the Word of God has been
faithfully received, interpreted, and proclaimed, the Spirit of God has convicted men and
women of their sin and led them to accept the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the
world. Those who repented and believed were baptized, "and rose to walk in newness of
life--new creatures in Christ Jesus; not to fashion themselves according to the former lusts,
but by the faith of the Son of God to follow in His steps, to reflect His character, and to purify
themselves even as He is pure. The things they once hated they now loved, and the things
they once loved they hated. The proud and self-assertive became meek and lowly of heart.
The vain and supercilious became serious and unobtrusive. The profane became reverent, the
drunken sober, and the profligate pure. The vain fashions of the world were laid aside.
Christians sought not the 'outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of
putting on of apparel; but . . . the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.' 1
Peter 3:3, 4" (The Great Controversy, pp. 461, 462).
But liberal Adventism offers another kind of reformation, based on a skeptical view of
Scripture and a reinterpretation of our biblical doctrine and lifestyle along the lines of
contemporary higher criticism. Tragically, this theological experiment is being offered to our
young people and other Adventists of our generation as the answer to their spiritual needs and
concerns. Is this version of Adventism genuine or counterfeit?
Adventism for a New Generation?
The analysis in the various parts of this chapter has highlighted how a growing body of our
influential authors seeks to make Adventism "relevant" to this generation. One scholar and
church administrator represents this new trend of scholarship when he calls for a "fresh
approach" to the historic Adventist understanding of end-time events so that the church will
be more "open to emphasizing the common bond with other Christians," and in this way make
Adventism "more relevant to this generation."2 Such calls for "relevance" (some would say
"liberation," "renewal" or even "reformation" within Adventism) have not gone unheeded.
An influential Adventist university chaplain and teacher has taken up this challenge and
developed it in a well-crafted book, Adventism for a New Generation. Endorsed by prominent
church administrators and educators, this work deserves some attention. It may represent the
kind of Adventism toward which the liberal left seeks to move mainstream Adventism.3
New Generation Adventism? The book's author rejects historic Adventism's
self-understanding as God's end-time remnant and its Bible-based lifestyle and morality,
dismissing these beliefs and practices as culturally conditioned to the nineteenth-century
Victorian age of Ellen G. White.
Believing that "our eschatology [our unique beliefs about last day events] has been built on
an unsound foundation, and that it has ultimately done us more arm than good," he writes:
"We must open ourselves to the possibility of new and different eschatological scenarios so
that we do not enter the twenty-first century with a nineteenth-century view of prophecy."4 He
asks: "Why has the [Adventist] church rigidly clung to an outmoded view of eschatology
which has focused on Sunday laws and Catholics rather then [sic] applying Christ-centered
eschatological principles to our world today?" He maintains that the church has too often
"overstated" its claims to remnant status. "Such claims, past and present, are unfortunate
evidence of unhealthy and dysfunctional religion in Adventism."5
138
A New Lifestyle. The author of Adventism for a New Generation also challenges the
church "to uplift and glorify Christ by calling all people to worship Him, and internalize the
principles of His kingdom." He envisions an Adventism that is emptied of its Bible-based
lifestyle: "As I have taught, counseled, and listened to Adventist young people over the last
seventeen years and as I reflect on my own experience in our church's schools, it is clear to
me that we must give up our preoccupation with externals and our obsession with control. It is
not the business of the church to prescribe for its members how they should behave on
Sabbath, what foods they should eat, in what forms of recreation or entertainment they may
participate, what books they can read, how they should dress, if they can wear jewelry, or
how they should think."6
Note that the new lifestyle was not developed from Scripture, but rather from empirical
data (listening to "young people") and a reflection on "my own experience."
The author rejects conservative Adventism because "such religion is known for its
'prooftext' approach to Scripture, and its uncompromising emphasis on 'correct doctrine' or
'objective truth'."7 Believing that the Bible "contains certain discrepancies in different ways"
and "theological errors," he seeks a "dynamic" revelation of truth that is consistent with a
"developmental process behind the doctrinal truths which unfold in the Bible" and which
"account for theological contradictions in the Bible."8
A New Morality. On premarital sex and masturbation, this author wants to free the new
generation of Adventists from "our Victorian heritage, which has been well preserved through
the work of Ellen White. Most Adventists are not aware of what bizarre and extreme views of
sexuality were commonly held by our nineteenth century ancestors. Books like Messages to
Young People have served to perpetuate such baggage throughout much of the twentieth
century as well. . . . I had a senior Bible teacher in academy in the 1970s who held similar
views, teaching us (much to our amusement) that any physical contact with the opposite sex
before marriage was wrong. Our Victorian heritage may be greater than we think."9
He continues: "Many Adventists have a 'masturbation-phobia' as a result of Ellen White's
extreme pronouncements about the practice. Her teaching on this topic was rooted in a
nineteenth century 'vital force' physiology which has no credibility in the medical community
today, and stands in stark contrast to the Bible's silence concerning masturbation. A balanced
Christian approach to sexual self-stimulation sees it as a potentially healthy form of sexual
discovery, exploration and awareness. It can even be a healthy equalizing force in marriages
where partners have significantly different amounts of sex drive."10
"Finally," he concludes, "the question of premarital sex is an important one. The biblical
principle that sexual intercourse be reserved for a monogamous marital relationship (Gen.
2:24) is increasingly being viewed as obsolete or impractical by young Christians. One reason
for this has been the church's tendency to address this issue in an 'all or nothing' context.
Sexuality, like spirituality, communication, or any other aspect of a relationship, must
develop and mature over time. Christian couples who have dated for a significant period need
to honestly discuss their convictions and sexual boundaries. Sexual exploration and
experimentation before marriage should respect these boundaries; ne should never put a
partner in the position of feeling guilty or sinful. We need to remember that God created sex
to be an enjoyable, pleasurable activity."11
Young unmarried Christians must set their own boundaries in their sexual conduct. "In
cases where [unmarried] couples do have intercourse before marriage, and wish to break this
behavior pattern, I often recommend an exercise called 'sexual pleasuring' that is commonly
prescribed in sexual therapy for impotence and premature ejaculation. These [unmarried]
139
couples need to realize that there is a wide range of sexual activities that can be tremendously
pleasurable and satisfying that do not involve sexual intercourse, and its accompanying risks.
Christian young people in general need to know their individual boundaries . . . from their
own study of scripture, and truly enjoy themselves in a guilt-free, balanced manner within
those boundaries. Those who criticize such young people for not living up to their standards
have no scriptural basis for their criticisms and no right to make themselves moral policemen
for other Christians."12
A New Ecumenism. The book castigates the Adventist church for its opposition to
ecumenism, saying that "there is a new ecumenism sweeping through much of the Christian
church today, that Adventism cannot afford to ignore." This is not the ecumenism of the
World Council of Churches, with its institutional and liberal political agenda. Instead, the
"new ecumenism" is identified with the charismatic movement.13
This Adventist author embraces the charismatic movement not only because of its
wonderful work of "intercessory prayer" in cities and communities, but also because of its
charismatic worship style: "My thinking about worship was transformed several years ago
when I attended the Anaheim Vineyard Fellowship. I was dumbfounded by what I saw.
Thousands of people worshipping God with a passion that I had never witnessed in any other
church. Some were standing, some were lifting up their arms, others were clapping, some
were sitting quietly in prayer or meditation, a few were jumping, and several were kneeling,
but they all seemed to be actively worshipping God. . . . Since that day, I have returned to the
Vineyard many times for my own spiritual nourishment and have longed to see the same kind
of worship emerge in Adventism. God's last people will be people who find worship to be the
most exciting and meaningful experience in life."14
Motivation for Ecumenism. Notice what he seeks to gain by this new ecumenism
identified with the charismatic movement: "If we were to renounce our past sectarian
mentality and embrace our communities by using our sanctuaries for non-denominational
Sunday services, people would think very differently about our schools and churches. We
would experience a dialogue with non-Adventist Christians that would not only benefit us but
would open many non-Adventist minds to the value and meaning of the Sabbath. It may be
that God raised us up as a people for such a time as this."15
Our author recognizes that the "spiritual ecumenicity" he is calling for will require
Adventists to "give up their own identities." But he does not seem to mind, since the
"intercessory prayer and a shared love for their cities and communities" are more important
than our doctrinal distinctives.16 He is fully aware of the significance of what he is
advocating:
"I believe that the consequences of this decision [alliance with the charismatic renewal
movement for "intercessory prayer"] will determine the future course of Adventism to a great
degree." But he explains that the kind of reformation he is calling for is warranted because
Adventist eschatology, which warns against unbiblical alliances,17 "has been built on an
unsound foundation, and that it has ultimately done us more harm than good." In his opinion,
Adventism's remnant theology, which is "more firmly ingrained in the Adventist psyche
because of Ellen White's powerful endorsement," leads to "ethnocentrism," "xenophobia," and
"paranoia."18
Consequently, he calls upon the church to outgrow the vice of isolationism and parochial
Christianity and embrace the virtues of an inclusive Christianity which will respond to the
needs of our cities and communities. Although he admits that it is "difficult for people who
were born and raised believing that they were God's Remnant Church, God's special chosen
140
people, to embrace an ecumenical spirit of any kind," he proceeds to suggest that we must
"stop thinking just of ourselves as 'God's chosen people' and start recognizing the existence
and ministry of 'God's chosen peoples.' It is a call to move from an ethnocentric remnant
theology to a spirit of religious affirmation which acknowledges that the 'kingdom of God on
earth' transcends every religious movement of humankind, and rejoices that the future
kingdom will include 'many mansions'."19
Some Suggested Strategies. Believing that it is "churches and movements that are willing
to lose their lives, or give up their own identities, for the kingdom of God that will find their
lives and be used by God to bring the greatest blessings to humanity," he suggests some
"practical things" Adventists can do "to contribute to this goal." Among these are:
"1. We can cease to think or speak of ourselves as the remnant church and see ourselves as
a part of God's larger remnant. 2. We can take advantage of the special opportunity we have
to attend other churches (since they meet on a different day) to befriend them, learn from
them, share with them, and affirm the good things we see in them. 3. Each of us can make a
special effort to maintain active membership in at least one non-Adventist community service
organization to combat our natural tendency to isolationism. 4. We can involve ourselves in
interdenominational bible study and/or [charismatic] intercessory prayer groups to broaden
our own spiritual perspectives. 5. We can come to see Christ, not as the possession of
Adventism or even of Christianity, but as the universal God and Saviour He is. Such a Christ
is much more appealing to non-Christians than the Christ of parochial Christianity."20
Hermeneutical Foundation. Since the author rightly recognizes that "theology is
dependent on one's hermeneutical approach to scripture,"21 it stands to reason that the
theological views expressed in Adventism for a New Generation are also established on its
author's "dynamic," "developmental," and "Christ-centered view of inspiration."22 He
develops this new approach to the Scriptures because he believes that "the Seventh-day
Adventist church has never fully outgrown the Fundamentalist view of Inspiration that it grew
up with in the nineteenth century"--a view of inspiration he characterizes as "a literal, rigid,
propositional, or 'proof text' interpretation of Scripture."23
In making the above assertion, he is simply singing the popular refrain from the chorus of
"New Generation" scholars who argue unjustifiably that the plain reading of Scripture
historically adopted by Seventh-day Adventists (the "proof text method," to use the
overworked expression) is somehow defective.24 He admits that the new views regarding
biblical authority and interpretation being circulated by the "New Generation" scholars are the
result of "a broader understanding of the nature of inspiration that has come through
Adventism's exposure to higher education and the application of the historical-critical method
to both Scripture and the writings of Ellen White."25
Reformation or Deformation? Readers should clearly understand that the above author is
not alone in holding this vision of an Adventism for a New Generation. He is one of the few
who, instead of spreading his views quietly, has had the courage to publicize them in print.
One influential Adventist educator, in endorsing the book, states that it is "one of those books
that demand attention and thought. . . . I recommend this book to pastors, educators and
thought leaders who want a thorough analysis of what 'might be' if we fully commit our
mission to the work of God."26
Besides the endorsers of this work, a number of other Adventist thought-leaders, scholars,
and church administrators are also demanding revisions in our historic Adventist doctrines to
make them "more relevant to this generation."27 While such ideas are prevalent, the most
141
vocal proponents (at least those currently in denominational employment) seldom publish
their revisionist views. Thus the theological views expressed in Adventism for a New
Generation must be seen as only the tip of a theological iceberg.
But are the calls for reformation within Adventism really designed to restore the biblical
truths held by our pioneers? Are the different approaches to Scripture, and the different
versions of Adventism they spawn, suggestive of a return to authentic Seventh-day
Adventism (if we can talk about "authentic" Adventism at all), or are these aberrations of
Adventism and hence, evidence of an identity crisis?28
What really does it mean when today we hear about renewal and intercessory prayer,
wonderful works for our "cities and communities," replacing the vice of ethnocentric remnant
theology with the virtues of "God's larger remnant"? Are the disdain for the works of our
pioneers, the giving up of the pillars of our faith, and the desire to align our church with the
charismatic movement indications of real reformation within the church? Or are they, rather, a
departure from the faith--a distortion of the biblical truths of Adventism?
Could the major cracks we see in the theological foundation of our faith be signs of an
impending crisis? Is it possible that "books of a new order"--the flurry of books and articles
being published, endorsed, and distributed--in our day are vital warnings of an end-time
deception--a deception that will closely parallel the "alpha" that took place in the days of
Ellen White?29
End-Time Deception? In the wake of the Kellogg crisis in the early 1900s, Ellen White
penned the following insightful scenario of what Satan sought to do in her day as well as in
ours:
"The enemy of souls has sought to bring in the supposition that a great reformation was to
take place among Seventh-day Adventists, and that this reformation would consist in giving
up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith, and engaging in a process of
reorganization. Were this reformation to take place, what would result? The principles of truth
that God in His wisdom has given to the remnant church, would be discarded. Our religion
would be changed. The fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last fifty
years would be accounted as error. A new organization would be established. Books of a new
order would be written. A system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced. The
founders of this system would go into the cities, and do a wonderful work. The Sabbath of
course, would be lightly regarded, as also the God who created it. Nothing would be allowed
to stand in the way of the new movement. The leaders would teach that virtue is better than
vice, but God being removed, they would place their dependence on human power, which,
without God, is worthless. Their foundation would be built on the sand, and storm and
tempest would sweep away the structure" (Selected Messages, 1:204-205).
In our final chapter we shall call attention to the implications of the above statement. At
the moment, however, we must note the striking parallels between the above statement and
the suggestions being made by advocates of the so-called Adventism for a New Generation:
(1) a repudiation of the doctrinal pillars of our faith;
(2) a quest for re-organization and new organizations (is this a reference to
congregationalism and ecumenical alliances?);
(3) a disdain for the historic principles (Adventist pioneers' alleged "literal," "rigid," and
"proof-text" method of interpretation, and the supposed "ethnocentric," "xenophobic," and
"paranoic" theology of the remnant?);
(4) the introduction of intellectual philosophy (the "dynamic," "developmental," and
"Christ-centered view of inspiration," and the sophisticated revision of Adventist theology to
make it intellectually acceptable to the "New Generation"?);
142
(5) the wonderful work in the cities (the charismatic "intercessory prayer" for renewal of
our "cities and communities"?);
(6) the disregard of the Sabbath (even while professing "t open many non-Adventist minds
to the value and meaning of the Sabbath"?);
(7) nothing stands in the way of this new movement (perhaps, the defiant and rebellious
spirit that says "I'll go my own way regardless of what the world church thinks"?);
(8) the exaltation of virtue above vice on the basis of secular and humanistic principles,
since God is left out, and the leaders depend on their own power (echoes of "justice,"
"compassion," "fairness," "equality," "moral imperative," "acceptance," "love," etc.?); and,
(9) the futility of building on a foundation of sand (the lethal bankruptcy of constructing
one's theological house on a foundation other than the Scriptures?).
Are we living in the days of a gathering storm, a storm which will soon sweep away any
theological structure built upon the sand? If so, is this the time to encourage the liberal left to
revise our understanding of apocalyptic books like Daniel, Revelation, and The Great
Controversy? Probably we are now in a better position to appreciate the full implications of
the series of questions we quoted in Chapter One:
"Aren't we triumphalistic in seeing ourselves as the one true church? Hasn't the
Sabbath/Sunday issue, so relevant when The Great Controversy was written, become obsolete
in today's secular society? Haven't Adventists erred in focusing on the pope while neglecting
to take a stand against oppressive dictators of the 20th century? Shouldn't we concentrate on
the modern 'beasts' of ethnic hatred, oppression of minorities, and abuse of the eco-system?
Perhaps apocalyptic, with its sensationalism, represents an immature stage of Christianity.
Perhaps we should replace it with the gospel of love, acceptance, and forgiveness."30
Where will the Adventist church be if we replace its historic doctrines--the three angels'
messages or the "everlasting gospel" (Rev 14:6-14), as we commonly refer to them--with a
gospel of mere "love, acceptance and forgiveness"? Can people preach such a gospel with
certainty and conviction? Will such a church grow?
The Problem of Church Growth
Certainly, the Seventh-day Adventist church is thriving worldwide--particularly in the
non-industrialized parts of the world. But Adventism is baptizing more people in the
developing world not because the "very minimal way of life" in these areas conditions people
to accept "anything that offers them a glimmer of hope for something better." On the contrary,
people in developing countries do not just accept "anything" that offers hope--such as the
kinds of fables or myths that liberal scholarship presents as "objective truths." People join
churches in which biblical truth is proclaimed with certainty, not with equivocation or
tentativeness.
Therefore, it is a gross over-simplification to conclude that Adventism in some parts of the
world is growing because "a person living in a mud hut somewhere is going to feel pretty
happy about the possibility of living in mansions in heaven."31 True happiness is not
measured by whether a person lives in a mud hut or a mansion. Instead, Jesus said, "If ye
know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John 13:17). Loving obedience to Christ is a
major secret of church growth. For, when Jesus lives in the heart, living in a hut offers more
joy than the "joy" of more--earthly mansions, possessions, position, power, etc.
A more accurate reason why churches are growing in certain parts of the world is that the
believers, teachers, evangelists, pastors, and leaders in these places still uphold the Bible's full
inspiration, absolute trustworthiness, and inal authority in all issues of doctrine and lifestyle.32
But a theological house constructed upon shifting sand cannot stand; neither can it attract
143
people who are seeking a church home as a place of refuge.
This is what is at stake in the quarrel between higher criticism and the historic Adventist
plain reading of Scripture. It is this issue that has divided North American scholars between
liberals and conservatives. It is this issue that has divided theological faculties. And if more
and more students, church members, and leaders adopt the defective methodology of higher
criticism, it becomes more likely that the worldwide church will be polarized theologically,
not culturally. In other words, if the trend continues, what will divide "the church of the
West" from "the rest of the church" will be their respective attitudes toward Scripture's
authority and interpretation.
One writer recently stumbled onto this truth: "The vote refusing the NAD permission to
ordain its women is the real 'tip of the iceberg,' the iceberg being the clash between scriptural
literalism, a view largely held in the developing world--Africa and much of South America
and Inter-America, and a principle-based approach to Scripture followed in areas where the
church has matured for a century and a half."33
Perception or Deception?
Our church faces a hermeneutical crisis--a crisis that threatens to divide our worldwide
family by undermining the very basis of our unique identity and mission. Challenging our
biblically-established doctrines is no indication of spiritual maturity or scholarly
enlightenment. Rather, it could signal the end-time departure from the faith which the Bible
writers and Ellen G. White prophesied (2 Tim 4:3-4; Amos 8:11-12; cf. Selected Messages,
1:204-205).
We have shown that those who reject the historic Adventist approach in favor of the
contemporary liberal approaches will ultimately deny the full authority of the Bible. When
this happens, they will be faced with two choices: "the authority of the church expressed
through its [liberal] theologians and/or administrators, and the assumed authority of the Spirit
expressed through charismatic renewal. In the former, the theological or administrative elite
determine for the church what parts of the Bible it may take as authoritative Scripture. In the
latter, religious experience and excitement, rather than the objective written Word of God,
determine the faith. The first leads to a Catholic understanding of the nature of the church, the
second to a Pentecostal understanding."34
Bible-believing Adventists need to be aware of what is at stake in this new papalism of the
scholar, administrator, or "charismatic" interpreter. "Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract
attention to man in the place of God. He leads the people to look to bishops, to pastors, to
professors of theology, as their guides, instead of searching the Scriptures to learn their duty
for themselves. Then, by controlling the minds of these leaders, he can influence the
multitudes according to his will" (The Great Controversy, p. 595).
Thus, the reading of Scripture through the hermeneutical lenses of the historical-critical
method is not evidence of true insight or clear perception but rather an omen of blindness or
deception. Ellen White anticipated our times when she wrote:
"In our day, as of old, the vital truths of God's word are set aside for human theories and
speculations. Many professed ministers of the gospel do not accept the whole Bible as the
inspired word. One wise man rejects one portion; another quesions another part. They set up
their judgment as superior to the Word; and the Scripture which they do teach rests upon their
own authority. Its divine authenticity is destroyed. Thus seeds of infidelity are sown
broadcast; for the people become confused and know not what to believe. . . . Christ rebuked
these practices in His day. He taught that the word of God was to be understood by all. He
pointed to the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority, and we should do the same. The
144
Bible is to be presented as the word of the infinite God, as the end of all controversy and the
foundation of all faith" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 39).
Let us not be misled by fancy labels that sound good--labels like: "historic method,"
"principle approach," "contextual approach," "casebook approach," "progressive approach,"
"dynamic approach," "developmental approach," "matured approach," "Christ-centered
approach," etc. Neither should we be misled by the suggestion that because "a majority of our
scholars" hold a particular view, that view must be right. Like the Bereans of old, we must
search the Scriptures to see whether the views they hold are biblically sound. And having
ascertained the truth for ourselves, whenever new views are urged upon us we must reply in
the words of Martin Luther: "Unless I am convinced by the plain testimony of Scripture, I
shall not recant."
Since the Bible is the only dependable source of knowledge about our Savior Jesus Christ
and His plan of salvation, we should heed this inspired counsel: "Brethren, cling to your
Bible, as it reads, and stop your criticisms in regard to its validity, and obey the Word, and not
one of you will be lost" (Selected Messages, 1:18).
In the above statement we find the two hermeneutical options facing the church: taking the
Bible "as it reads" (the historic Adventist plain reading of Scripture) and "criticisms"
(liberalism's historical-critical methods). The choice we make will result in either clear
perception or blind deception regarding the biblical message.
The relevance of the above counsel will become clearer in the next chapter, "Contending
for the Word." But as we conclude the current chapter we would echo Ellen White's plea:
"Brethren, cling to your Bible, as it reads, and stop your criticisms in regard to its validity,
and obey the Word, and not one of you will be lost" (Selected Messages, 1:18).

spirit of intercession to pray for their respective cities. This kind of intercessory prayer
ministry is very developed in some cities and virtually non-existent in others. But no one can
deny that it is the spoken will of Christ (John 17:21). My prayer is that Adventism will be on

to bring the greatest blessings to humanity. When we are willing to let go of our own future,

receive the remnant promise" (ibid., pp. 314-315).

24. Refer to our chapter 4 for a detailed discussion. Notice that a similar statement has
come from a group who identify themselves as "Evangelical Adventists": "While early
Adventists were clearly committed to scripture, they did not understand how to interpret it.
They often used a proof-text method of biblical interpretation to defend their distinctive
beliefs and consequently missed the overall, uniting purpose of scripture as a revelation of
God's salvation" (M. Rader, D. van Denburgh, and L. Christoffel, "Evangelical Adventism:
Clinging to the Cross," Adventist Today, January/February, 1994, p. 16). The origin of
Evangelical Adventism goes back to the crisis occasioned by Desmond Ford and to the paper
Evangelica, which was published in the years after Glacier View Conference in 1980.

Chapter Six
Contending for the Word
In the previous chapter we showed how some Seventh-day Adventists are departing from
the Word. But this deviation from the Word cannot be fully understood unless it is seen in its
total cosmic framework. As we suggested at the end of that chapter, skepticism towards the
full inspiration, trustworthiness, and the sole authority of Scripture is a vital phase in the
enemy's end-time strategy to lead God's people away from the pillars of their faith and
especially from the Spirit of Prophecy.
The Enemy's Plan. "'It is Satan's plan to weaken the faith of God's people in the
Testimonies,' 'Satan knows how to make his attacks. He works upon minds to excite jealousy
and dissatisfaction toward those at the head of the work. The gifts are next questioned; then,
of course, they have but little weight, and instruction given through vision is disregarded.'
'Next follows skepticism in regard to the vital points of our faith, the pillars of our position,
then doubt as to the Holy Scriptures, and then the downward march to perdition. When the
Testimonies, which were once believed, are doubted and given up, Satan knows the deceived
ones will not stop at this; and he redoubles his efforts till he launches them into open
rebellion, which becomes incurable and ends in destruction'" (Testimonies for the Church,
5:672, emphasis supplied).
Disregard of the Bible. "The agencies which will unite against truth and righteousness in
this contest are now actively at work. God's holy word, which has been handed down to us at
such a cost of suffering and blood, is but little valued. The Bible is within the reach of all, but
there are few who really accept it as the guide of life. Infidelity prevails to an alarming extent,
not in the world merely, but in the church. Many have come to deny doctrines which are the
very pillars of the Christian faith. The great facts of creation as presented by the inspired
writers, the fall of man, the atonement, and the perpetuity of the law of God, are practically
rejected, either wholly or in part, by a large share of the professedly Christian world.
Thousands who pride themselves upon their wisdom and independence regard it an evidence
of weakness to place implicit confidence in the Bible; they think it a proof of superior talent
and learning to cavil at the Scriptures and to spiritualize and explain away their most
important truths. Many ministers are teaching their people, and many professors and teachers
are instructing their students, that the law of God has been changed or abrogated; and those
who regard its requirements as still valid, to be literally obeyed, are thought to be deserving
only of ridicule or contempt" (The Great Controversy, pp. 582-583).
The Need to Contend for the Faith
Inspired Warnings. The apostle Paul warned: "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the
latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of
devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron" (1 Tim 4:1, 2).
Ellen G. White had this text in mind when she explained the reason for her published writings.
She wrote: "I am instructed that the Lord, by His infinite power, has preserved the right hand
of His messenger for more than half a century, in order that the truth may be written out as He
149
bids me write it for publication, in periodicals and books. Why?-- Because if it were not thus
written out, when the pioneers in the faith shall die, there would be many, new in the faith, who
would sometimes accept as messages of truth teachings that contain erroneous sentiments and
dangerous fallacies. Sometimes that which men teach as 'special light' is in reality specious error,
which, as tares sown among the wheat, will spring up and produce a baleful harvest. And errors
of this sort will be entertained by some until the close of this earth's history" (This Day with God,
p. 126, emphasis supplied).
Given the strange winds of doctrine blowing in our day, can we doubt that our generation
could be witnessing the predicted end-time departure from the faith? Skepticism abounds with
regard to vital pillars of our faith; doubts are created about the Holy Scriptures; our critics despise
the historic plain reading of Scripture as a "literal," "rigid," "proof-text" or "Fundamentalist"
method; "books of a new order" are being published and distributed; doctrinal tares are being
broadcast by voice and by pen. And at a time when we most need the Testimonies, we are being
told that Mrs. White's messages were culturally conditioned; if relevant at all, they are suitable
only for devotional purposes. These prevailing conditions demand a courageous, resolute
response.
Contending for the Word. The admonition of Jude, the brother of our Lord Jesus Christ, is
particularly applicable to our times: "Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about
the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for
all entrusted to the saints. For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have
secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a
license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord" (Jude 3, 4 NIV).
Ellen White stated in a similar context: "My message to you is: No longer consent to listen
without protest to the perversion of truth. Unmask the pretentious sophistries which, if received,
will lead ministers and physicians and medical missionary workers to ignore the truth. Every one
is now to stand on his guard. God calls upon men and women to take their stand under the
blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel. I have been instructed to warn our people; for many
are in danger of receiving theories and sophistries that undermine the foundation pillars of the
faith" (Selected Messages, 1:196-197).
She asked: "What are God's servants doing to raise the barrier of a 'Thus saith the Lord' against
this evil? The enemy's agents are working unceasingly to prevail against the truth.1 Where are the
faithful guardians of the Lord's flocks? Where are His watchmen? Are they standing on the high
tower, giving the danger signal, or are they allowing the peril to pass unheeded?" (ibid., p. 194,
emphasis supplied).
Responding to the Call. The late Enoch de Oliveira (1924-1992), a church administrator from
Brazil, clearly understood what was at stake in the hermeneutical crisis. Prior to his retirement, he
served as president of the South American Division (1975-1980) and vice-president of the General
Conference (1980-1990) during a period that saw major theological turmoi in the church. One of
his lasting contributions to the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist church was his great courage in
contending for the Word against the inroads of theological liberalism.
The insightful address that follows, "A Trojan Horse Within the Church," was the keynote
sermon Elder Oliveira delivered at the International Convention of the Adventist Theological
Society held in Indianapolis, June 28-30, 1990, just prior to the General Conference session.
Although conditions in the church now may differ somewhat from those in 1990, this sermon
aptly summarizes the concerns undergirding this book. It may also be read as Oliveira's farewell
message to the worldwide church; two years after delivering this message, he was laid to his rest.2
"A Trojan Horse Within the Church"3
150
In one of his famous epics, Homer describes the clever device the Greeks employed to
conquer the city of Troy during the Trojan war.
To enable the Greeks to enter the legendary city by stealth, the master carpenter, Epeius,
built a huge hollow wooden horse. According to Homer, 100,000 soldiers besieged Troy. The
ten-year siege ended when the Greeks concealed some soldiers in the horse and then left it
behind as they pretended to withdraw.
Despite the warning of Laocoön, Sinon persuaded the Trojans to move the horse inside the
city walls. At night the Greek army returned and the soldiers who had hidden inside the horse
opened the city gates to their comrades. In this way Troy was invaded successfully and
destroyed.
Although the war between the Greeks and the city of Troy is generally considered a
historical fact, the episode dealing with the Trojan horse has been considered a mythological
tale. Nonetheless, from this epic we can derive some timely illustrations that are applicable to
the situation our church finds itself in today.
For many years the Seventh-day Adventist church succeeded in bravely and tenaciously
resisting the fearful assaults of the enemy. The walls of the "holy city" remained impregnable.
But in his determination to conquer and destroy God's church, the prince of this world has
undertaken to employ clever and deadly secret weapons.
"There is nothing that the great deceiver fears so much," wrote Ellen G. White, "as that we
shall become acquainted with his devices" (The Great Controversy, p. 516).
After many attempts to conquer the "city of God" by applying the same kind of deceitful
action employed by the Greeks, the great adversary has been able to obtain his ends by
surreptitiously introducing the Trojan horse of liberalism within the walls of Zion.
Now that liberalism has become operative within our church, we perceive how vulnerable
we can be to the assaults of Satan. As a church we have been inclined to believe that our
greatest danger of being defeated by the powers of evil would come from without. While we
may be able to perceive clearly from the walls of Zion what Satan is doing to conquer and
destroy the church, we do not seem able to do much about standing firmly against the evils
that are developing insidiously within our midst. Ellen White warns: "We have more to fear
from within than from without" (Selected Messages, 1:122).
Liberals Are Not Bad People
Those who are promoting liberalism in our ranks are not "bad" people. They are committed
believers. Many of them exhibit the beauty of Christian virtues in their lives. Most of them
love the church. They would like to share the faith and certainties of our forefathers, but in the
honesty of their hearts, they do not have them. They are unable to see the uniqueness of our
message, the distinctiveness of our identity, the eschatological dimension of our hope, or the
urgency of our mission. Representing a wide spectrum of religious thought, they attempt to
reinterpret traditional theological Seventh-day Adventist thinking by dressing some of our old
doctrines in what appear to them to be new and attractive semantic garments.
Why are these people advocating liberal views among us? Why are they so enthusiastically
playing the role of apostles of change in our theological system?
First of all, it seems to me, they are eager to discard the "cult" label that has been used so
widely to characterize Seventh-day Adventism. They long to see our religious movement
become a part of what they consider mainstream Christianity. In their endeavor to attain
religious "respectability," they suggest the reinterpretation of some historical views of our
theology that they believe are Biblically indefensible.
151
Although accepting some aspects of our distinctiveness, such as the Sabbath and our health
principles, they believe that the time has come for revision in our theological system. In
fostering such a revision, some feel uncomfortable with the "remnant" concept as understood
by the founders of our message. They believe that all "sectarian mentality" should be rejected
as presumptuous and arrogant.
Other liberals, in their endeavor to make our theology more "relevant," question the
integrity of the sanctuary doctrine and unite their voices with those of our opponents in this
matter. They explain the two-phase ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary as a
face-saving device created by Edson, Crosier, and others to bail our pioneers out of the
Millerite failure.
There are those who are alarmed about what seems to them to be excessive borrowing by
Ellen White of material from a variety of sources. Misguided by distorted ideas about the way
inspiration works, they are willing to challenge the validity of her claims, rejecting her
prophetic authority.
Some liberals define our eschatology as a by-product of nineteenth-century North
American culture and, as such, as deserving of substantial reformulation. They insist that after
145 years of proclamation we can no longer preserve the fervent expectation that permeated
the church in its formative years.
Liberal scientists in the church insist that the creation doctrine should be reevaluated in the
context of current scientific information and hypotheses.
According to the February 5, 1990 issue of Christianity Today, the obsession for change in
the Seventh-day Adventist ranks had its beginnings in the 1950s and 1960s, when our
students in much larger numbers than before began to attend non-Adventist seminaries and
universities seeking advanced degrees. Some of these students, in spite of unfavorable
circumstances, were able to preserve their religious experience and came forth strengthened in
their convictions. Others, influenced by modern Biblical criticism and liberal theology,
reshaped their beliefs.
What Is Being Gained by These Attempts at Change?
What are we gaining from the liberal attempts to make our message more "palatable" to the
world? When so many seeds of doubt, uncertainty, and strife are sown, what else can be
expected? Liberalism is reaping what it has sown. It sowed unbelief and it is harvesting
apostasies.
During the early 1980s, an unprecedented number of ministers and lay people left the
church in Australia and New Zealand. During the 1970s our church in those two countries lost
one believer for every three who came in. In 1981, after a particularly notable attempt to
effect a liberal change, the percentage of loss rose to 46 percent. It peaked at 63 per cent in
1982 and then settled down at approximately 50 percent--a loss of one member for every two
believers. (See Australasian Record, Oct. 28, 1989.)
We must not remain indifferent to such staggering losses. We must not minimize the tragic
consequences of our internal confrontations caused by new theologies. The casualties are
thousands of perplexed souls who, spiritually confused, are departing from us, throwing away
their confidence in the validity of our message. They have lost the landmarks of our faith and
no longer have a clear understanding of what we stand for.
The following set of North American Division statistics reflects the consequences of
ongoing theological and other attempts to change our beliefs in the United States and Canada:
Years Annual Growth Rates
152
1931-1940 4.4%
1941-1950 3.1%
1951-1960 2.9%
1961-1970 2.8%
1971-1980 3.2%
1981-1988 2.3%
What is the message in these numbers? Oscar Wilde, famous dramatist of the past century,
with inimitable irony affirmed that "there are three kinds of lies in the world: common lies,
small lies, and statistics." Thus Wilde underlined the fact that statistics may deceive and lead
us to wrong conclusions. But even though statistics are susceptible of incorrect interpretation,
we dare not minimize their importance in an analysis of the crisis that we face. They can help
us understand the gravity of our problems.
It is true that we can be deceived by numbers and conclude that in spite of what seems
apparent the North American Division is still growing. But it is not growing. According to
reliable sources, 30 to 35 percent of our believers no longer attend church. With this decrease
in attendance has come a decrease in offerings. Sharp cutbacks in church budgets have been
approved. Enrollment in our schools is declining. Institutions have been closed. We are in the
process of trimming down our church's operations and reducing our task forces. The market
for our books is shrinking. Denominational periodicals have been merged and yet their
circulation has still dropped. We have come to a time of financial restraints, with most
conferences cutting back on their ministerial forces. These are inevitable consequences of
what has happened in theological areas.
After so many seeds of doubt and uncertainty have been sown within the church by those
who are obsessed with the desire to reinterpret our theology, after so many years of
theological disputation, what else should we expect? We are witnessing the inevitable harvest
of liberalism. When unbelief is sown, the harvest is bound to be apostasy.
After its insidious penetration within the walls of God's city, liberalism in its various
shapes and forms has succeeded in opening the gates of the church to the invasion of such
other evils as pluralism, secularism, humanism, materialism, futurism, and preterism.
Pluralism
To diffuse the polarization we are facing, some articulate scholars suggest the official
adoption of theological pluralism, the acceptance of peaceful coexistence of conflicting, even
opposing, views among us.
"On fundamental beliefs, unity; on non-essentials, liberty; in everything, love," is the
popular dictum that inspires pluralistic scholars in their appeal for flexibility and openness.
But who is going to determine what is essential and what is negotiable? Individuals,
independent ministries, theological societies, the annual council, or the church as a whole
under the guidance of the Holy Spirit? Would we be able to retain our self understanding as
God's last prophetic movement, if we were to fragment our beliefs by including in them
divergent schools of thought?
153
We need theological unity in our preaching and in our publications, but above all, we need
unity in the theological departments of our colleges and universities. I submit that no school
of theology, under pluralistic influences, shaken by the confrontation of ideas, is able to
produce preachers with strong convictions. Without preachers having certainty, there is no
power in their preaching.
The successful spread of the gospel over the Mediterranean world in the days of the
apostles threatened Christian unity. People of widely divergent backgrounds were baptized,
bringing into the church some of the popular religious concepts of the age. Thus, there was a
real danger that the teachings of the church would be affected by syncretism. Aware of this
danger, Paul exhorted the Ephesians to maintain unity. See Eph 4:4-6.
Addressing "the churches of Galatia," the apostle expressed his regret for the way the
Galatians, under pluralistic influences, changed their minds and turned away from the grace
of Christ to a "different" gospel (Gal 1:6). Was Paul being narrow-minded in his appeal for
unity? After all, those Jewish-Christians certainly preached salvation through Christ. They
never denied, as far as we know, that it was necessary to believe in Jesus as Messiah and
Saviour. Why then was Paul so vehement in his opposition to this Jewish-Christian
preaching? Because the Judaizers insidiously distorted the gospel of Christ, throwing the
believers into a state of mental and spiritual confusion. At the real risk of being labeled
intransigent, Paul exhorted the Galatians to pay no attention to those messengers who,
claiming ecclesiastical authority, were disrupting the peace and unity that had existed among
the saints.
Let's Learn from Methodist Experience
Methodism in our day is known for its wide latitude of beliefs. Its clergy have freedom to
subscribe to different schools of Bible interpretation. Attempts to define basic Methodist
doctrine have met much opposition, and Methodist theology has become surprisingly
divorced from its own tradition. Persons who want to be accepted as church members are no
longer required to endorse any specific creed. To the question, "What do Methodists believe,"
ministers and laity respond by saying that they believe in Jesus.
Today the Methodist Church is in a steep numerical decline. "In the 1965-1975 period the
United Methodist Church lost over one million members," says C. Peter Wagner, Leading
Your Church t Growth, p. 32. And who is responsible for this sharp defection? The exodus
that the Methodists are facing is not to be blamed on outside forces. The real blame lies
within their church. If the Methodist Church were attacked by enemies from outside, if it were
suffering persecution as a result of its endeavors to evangelize the world, there would be
hope. But the world does not persecute a church that seems to stand for nothing. The
Methodist Church is declining as a result of its failure to preserve its own religious heritage.
Can we learn some profitable lessons from its perplexing experience?
Preterism, Historical Criticism, and Futurism
A segment of the Seventh-day Adventist scholarly community no longer accepts the
principles of prophetic interpretation that made our church what it is.
In the books of Daniel and Revelation, our pioneers found our time and our mission.
Applying the historicist method of prophetic interpretation, which had been used by the
majority of Christians over the centuries and which earned the subsequent endorsement of
Ellen G. White, our forefathers were able to unfold the history of the long conflict between
Christ and Satan. They were able to look upon themselves as an integral part of the cosmic
154
program.
Today, however, we sense a gradual rejection of the historicist approach and a growing
acceptance of the Counter Reformation schools of prophetic interpretation. Furthermore,
historical-criticism does not allow for true long-range prediction. As a result, in some quarters
our message has been changed and has lost its distinctiveness and its power.
Moving the fulfillment of the long-term prophecies to the end of the age (the futurist
view), or relegating their significance to the distant past (the preterist view), or denying true
long-term prophecy (the historical-critical view), makes the prophecies of Daniel and
Revelation irrelevant and transforms the Adventist movement into just another denomination
without power and special prophetic message.
Secularism
Another intruder that is expanding its presence within the walls of God's city is the trend
known as "secularism," often defined as the organization of life as if God did not exist. Its
growing influence is producing a decline in attendance, reduced commitment to Christian
ideals, and an increasing tendency to view the church--any church--as obsolete and irrelevant.
Professional growth and prestige, business and profits, economic status and academic
attainments are overestimated, while Christian virtues are neglected, or relegated to second
place.
According to Norman Blaike, American Christians today can be divided into two groups,
the "supernaturalists" and the "secularists." The "supernaturalists," Blaike observes, are
generally to the right theologically, while the "secularists" are to the left. The
"supernaturalists," he states, prize Christian virtues, such as devotion, piety, and church
commitments, while "secularists" admire tolerance, success, efficiency, and academic
achievements. (See N. W. H. Blaike, "Atruism in the Professions: The Case of the Clergy,"
Australia and New Zealand Journal of Sociology, 10 [1974]:87.)
The process of secularization is affecting not only believers but also institutions.
According to George Marsden, Duke University historian, the religious character of many
erstwhile Christian institutions has been eclipsed with "nobody noticing and nobody seeming
to mind" (Time, May 22, 1989).
In the past two decades we have seen Seventh-day Adventist institutions affected by
substantial changes that have not all been on the plus side. Surreptitiously, secularism makes
inroads that tend to eclipse the religious character of these institutions. Religious services are
still held in their chapels, but they are more a form than a spiritual force.
Theological liberalism makes an immense contribution to this insidious secularism of
believers and institutions by its rejection of an authoritative church, an authoritative Bible,
and an authoritative body of truth. It is more than willing to accommodate religion to the
spirit of the times.
Other Evils
Other evils, such as exaggerated academic freedom, the historical-critical approach to
Scripture, and theistic evolution (with its very long chronology) are making their contribution
to the undermining of confidence in basic beliefs and leading congregations to spiritual
disaster.
It is impossible to prevent the teaching of aberrant views within the church, when the
concept of academic freedom without sound confessional responsibility is accepted.
Defenders of academic freedom in our midst state that we are not a creedal denomination and
155
so every believer should be free to endorse different theological views. But we understand
that if an individual is a Seventh-day Adventist, he or she should subscribe to our
Fundamental Beliefs in their entirety. Otherwise, he or she ceases to be a Seventh-day
Adventist.
I still remember the strong opposition manifested by some Adventist scholars when the
historical-critical methodology was condemned officially by the General Conference on the
basis that this method, by definition, excludes our belief in the transcendence of the
Scriptures.[4]
I believe, however, that the church has the unquestionable right to decide which approach
should be used by our scholars and preachers. This is our only safeguard to protect our
religious heritage, which subscribes to the Reformation principle that the Bible is the
infallible Word of God and its own interpreter. Theistic evolution (or progressive creationism)
is a concept accepted by a growing number of scientists in our ranks. It involves the
subordination and accommodation of the Scriptures to the Darwinian view of gradual
evolution. Those who endorse this school of thought no longer regard key portions of the
Bible as reliable sources of historical information. In taking this position they place scientific
hypotheses above Scripture, making science a judge of the Word of God.
The Fifth Column
The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) left a million dead. Wen the conflict seemed to be
reaching its climax, General Emilio Mola commanded four columns moving toward the
capital of the country. But in addition to his four columns he was counting on a fifth column,
one that had entered Madrid behind its defenses, to deliver the city to him when the decisive
moment arrived.
Among the lessons that history teaches us, we find the fall of empires and institutions that
succumbed to internal forces. The historian Gibbon (1737-1796) ascribes the fall even of
Rome to internal, not external, causes. He mentions the fourteenth-century Italian poet,
Petrarch, who described the fall of Rome as follows: "Behold the remains of Rome, the
shadow of its early greatness! Neither time nor the barbarians can glory in having brought
about this stupendous destruction: it was accomplished by its own citizens, the most
illustrious of her children."
Many civilizations have been defeated by the internal sabotage of fifth columnists. History
warns us what can take place in the church. External opposition is not our worst enemy.
Instead, the insidious deteriorating influences introduced by Satan, our great adversary, do the
most harm.
What has been the greatest defeat suffered by the Christian church? Was it the loss of life
as a result of violence, martyrdom, and torture? No. The church's greatest defeat took place
when it accepted the favor of the Roman Empire and lost its purity and fervor. When the
church left the catacombs, it adjusted to the splendor of the world. Satan's fifth
columnists--his Trojan horse--weakened the church internally, paving the way for dilution of
faith and the establishment of pseudo-Christianity.
Conclusion
The picture I have presented of the Seventh-day Adventist church can be considered bleak
and dark. But in my closing remarks, I would like to present a brighter side. In spite of the
problems we face today, we have many reasons to believe in the triumph of our message as
long as we stay faithful to the Bible. A revival will come and our eyes will see powerful
156
miracles of evangelism.
Our message and movement deserve to be characterized by a triumphant spirit. They are
not based on "cunningly devised fables" but on the unshakable foundation of "the sure word
of prophecy."
"The church may appear as about to fall, but it does not fall. It remains, while the sinners
in Zion will be sifted out--the chaff separated from the precious wheat" (Selected Messages,
2:380).
The conviction that God guides this movement allows us to declare, without a shadow of
doubt, that the fire on Seventh-day Adventist altars will never go out. The determination to
win the world to Christ will motivate us in our united evangelistic program. The world will be
lighted with the glory of our proclamation of the Advent hope.

Chapter Seven
Upholding the Word1
In our day we see an indifference, even a reluctance, on the part of some Christians to
allow the Bible to address contemporary issues of faith and practice. Thus, the Bible is
believed to be silent on almost every question--abortion, homosexuality, women's ordination,2
polygamy, war, divorce and remarriage, etc. This attitude is a symptom of the theological
uncertainty infecting much of Christendom.
Reflecting upon the situation in Protestant churches, a well-respected evangelical scholar
remarked, "The outside observer sees us as staggering on from gimmick to gimmick and stunt
to stunt like so many drunks in a fog, not knowing at all where we are or which way we
should be going. Preaching is hazy; heads are muddled; hearts fret; doubts drain our strength;
uncertainty paralyzes action." Moreover, Bible-believing Christians are told that "the wish to
be certain is mere weakness of the flesh, a sign of spiritual immaturity."3
The technical name for this state of affairs is "theological pluralism." And while its
advocates celebrate the "diversity" of theological views as a mark of open-mindedness, the
Bible writers call it an end-time loss of faith in the Bible and its God (2 Tim 4:3-4; cf. Isa
5:21). Such erosion of the Bible's authority leads Christians to choose and accept only those
parts of the Bible palatable to their taste. When this happens, the Bible is taken merely as an
inspiring booklet, rather than an inspired Book.
How and why did this happen? How is it playing out in the churches? How is it affecting
the attitude of Christians on issues of faith and practice? And how can Christians continue
upholding the Word in an age of theological pluralism?
The Silence of the Bible
Over two decades ago, James D. Smart observed with great concern "the growing silence
of the Scriptures" in the preaching and teaching of the church and in the consciousness of
Christian people, "a silence that is perceptible even among those who are most insistent upon
their devotion to the Scriptures." Smart described a conspiracy among the various liberal and
conservative factions of Christianity to reduce the Bible to a subordinate status in the church.
He argued that because an open attack upon the whole Bible, or even upon a portion of it
(e.g., the Old Testament), would undoubtedly have met with almost universal resistance, their
strategy was to work "unobtrusively, not by any concerted plan of any faction but as the result
of factors that ae at work unconsciously in all of us." If successful, the conspiracy would
create a situation in which most Christians would "awaken one day to find ourselves a church
almost totally alienated from the Scriptures." Smart found the scheme so dangerous that he
felt compelled in his book "to sound an alarm."4
Although Bible-believing Christians cannot agree with Smart's own liberal position on
biblical authority, yet his observation on the growing silence of the Bible has merit. Until the
eighteenth-century Enlightenment, the overwhelming majority of Christians affirmed faith in
the full inspiration, trustworthiness, and dependability of the entire Bible as the Word of God.
Since the rise of rationalism, however, various attempts have been made to silence the
authority of the Bible on issues of faith and life. These have taken several forms: from
(1) outright denial of the uniqueness of God's word, through (2) hesitancy to accept its
teaching because of its supposed ambiguities, inconsistencies, or irrelevance to contemporary
158
issues, to (3) reinterpretation of its teaching to accommodate unbiblical views and lifestyles.
Although some of the most creative theological minds of the century contributed to
undermining faith in the Scriptures, the "conspiracy" to silence the Bible was not recently
hatched by some liberals or conservatives, as Smart suggests. Actually, silencing the Bible
has been Satan's master strategy all through history.
Satan's Master Strategy
Genesis 3:1-6 not only tells of the human race's fall but also describes the strategy Satan
followed. Approaching Eve in the guise of a serpent, he employed a two-fold scheme to
undermine the Word of God. First, he asked, "Did God really say that . . . ?" thus raising
doubts about the nature of God's Word. This is no different from the contemporary skepticism
over the inspiration of the contents of the entire Bible.
Second, Satan moved from the nature of God's Word to a methodological issue--the
question of interpretation. In effect he argued, "Let's even assume that God actually said
something to you. Do you think that He really means what He said?" This question takes
different forms today: Does the Bible really teach that Christians should not lie, steal, kill, or
break the Sabbath under any circumstances? Does the Word of God really forbid
homosexuality, polygamy, abortion, the use of alcohol, or the wearing of jewelry?
In other words, the Genesis account of the fall highlights two major reasons for the erosion
of biblical authority: (1) uncertainty over the nature of the Word of God (inspiration) and (2)
uncertainty over how it should be understood (interpretation or hermeneutics). Mistaken
views in these areas set the stage for theological pluralism. Notice how the crisis came to
Adam and Eve.
The Lord explicitly stated that they would "surely die" if they disobeyed His Word. Satan
countered: "You will not surely die." The two statements are contradictory and lead to
different destinations. But contemporary pluralistic scholars, following the lead of Satan,
maintain that both contradictory statements are true. They even pride themselves on believing
that this kind of pluralism of thought is a mark of "open-mindedness"--the very lie that Satan
told, when he said to Adam and Eve, "Your eyes shall be opened. . . ."
Because theologians are the architects of theological pluralism, and because it is they who
have laid the foundation for the erosion of biblical authority in the various churches, we will
briefly summarize the confusing voices of scholarship regarding the exact nature of the
Bible's insiration and how the Bible should be understood.
Scholars and the Word of God
Bible-believing Christians have always held that the entire Scripture, consisting of the
sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments, is the authoritative word of God. They
believe that the Holy Spirit so guided the Bible writers that even though they employed their
own words to communicate the message, what they finally put down in writing is a
trustworthy and dependable account of God's message (2 Pet 1:20-21; 2 Tim 3:16). The
written Word is, therefore, not merely the words of fallible men, but the Word of the living
God which should be accepted, believed, and obeyed (1 Thess 2:13). But this historic
Christian belief is being challenged in several ways.
Over a century ago, B. B. Warfield, one of the leading scholars who brought the issue of
biblical inspiration to the forefront of discussion, quipped that "wherever five 'advanced
thinkers' assemble, at least six theories as to inspiration are likely to be ventilated."5
Conflicting positions on inspiration have led to a plurality in methods of Bible interpretation.
159
This plurality in turn has led to the reduction of the Bible's authority, as is evident in the
subtle, even ambiguous, manner in which the Bible has been described. A few examples will
illustrate this shrinking authority of the Bible from an objective Book to a subjective booklet.
New Views on the Word of God. For instance, some scholars, following the influential
Swiss theologian Karl Barth, hold that the Bible only contains the Word of God or that it only
only becomes the Word of God to individuals when it grips their hearts. In this view, unless
the Bible "becomes" the word of God to the interpreter or reader, it is only the word of fallible
human beings. This belief, known as neo-orthodoxy, might well be described as the "potential
Word of God" position.
Other scholars teach that not every part of the Bible is inspired. In their estimation some
sections reflect the mistaken opinions of the Bible writers. Not accepting the Bible in its
entirety as inspired, they use higher critical methods to determine which parts are accurate or
true and what, if anything, some portions of the Bible can teach us about the beliefs and
history of the times.
These theologians would see the Bible as either a partial Word of God (if the alleged
mistakes in the Bible are counted as substantial), or they would treat the Bible as primarily
the Word of God (if the alleged inaccuracies are deemed few). But in either case, based on
their theories of inspiration and interpretation, these scholars reject the Bible as entirely God's
authoritative Word, dependable and trustworthy in all of its teachings. They accept only the
portions of Scripture that "make sense" to them or which support positions they already hold.
In so doing, they reduce the Bible from an inspired Book to an inspiring booklet--the latter
referring to those portions they consider worthy of God's inspiring activity.
Catchy Phrases. Theologians use well-crafted phrases to express their revised ideas of
biblical authority. For example, one English theologian has suggested the phrase "Scripture
as a whole" instead of "the whole Scripture"; another person proposed the expression,
"biblical authorization" rather than "biblical authority"; other scholars believe that the
Scriptures provide only a "biblical direction" (or trajectory, flow, or plot, as in a play) and not
necessarily a "biblical directive." One ecumenical document described the Bible as possssing
a "normative priority," but not in the sense of "normative supremacy."6 John Shelby Spong,
the Episcopal bishop of Newark, understands the Bible as "a historic narrative of the journey
of our religious forbears," not "a literal road map to reality."7 None of the above subtle
phrases ascribes full authority or normative role to the whole Bible as the Word of God.
Some otherwise Bible-believing scholars are finding these new ideas on the Bible
appealing. For instance, one prominent evangelical scholar suggested that when Christians
approach the Bible, they must "look to it with an expectation of finding God's sure word in
it." He urged readers of the Bible to "listen in faith for the Word of God in these human words
. . . in spite of all its [the Bible's human] limitations."8 The implication is that the Bible is not
the Word of God but only contains the Word of God.
This view has found liturgical expression in some churches where the traditional
expression before the reading of the Scriptures, "Let us listen to the Word of God," has been
replaced by the statement, "Let us listen for the word of God." Another spin-off of this
approach is found in some schools of missiology and contextual theology which attempt to
isolate the cultural and supracultural elements from Scripture. Thus, one evangelical
theologian asserts that the Bible is an inspired classic casebook, a collection of case studies
portraying and interpreting instances of divine-human encounter;9 or, as one Adventist
scholar promotes, the Bible is a casebook, as distinguished from a codebook.10
Impact on the Bible
160
Each of the above discordant notes within scholarly circles is a sophisticated challenge to
the historic Christian view of the inspiration and authority of the Bible. And each of them
employs, for the study of the Scriptures, some modified version of the historical-critical
method of interpretation--a method which masquerades as "scientific" but which in actuality
is a pagan ideology.11 When scholars pass the Bible through this critical shredding machine,
what remains is a Bible bruised, battered, and torn to pieces.
Fragmented Text. Roman Catholic scholar Sandra M. Schneiders' evaluation of the
historical-critical approach to the Bible may be equally applicable to most of the
contemporary approaches to the Word of God. She noted that over the last century, "scholars
seemed to be caught in an infinite historical regress, tracing the ever more remote explanation
of the ever more fragmented text into an ever receding antiquity that was ever less relevant to
the concerns of the contemporary believer."12
Spiritual Emptiness. According to one knowledgeable Adventist scholar, "These methods
raise all sorts of questions about how we got the text but say nothing about the truths it
contains. It is like a hungry man who sits down to banquet and only dissects the food, probing
down to the plate, cogitating on how each item may have arrived on the dish, but who eats
nothing and leaves empty."13
Loss of Faith. As a result of the doubts being raised on many Bible passages, 1) preachers
no longer preach with conviction on any subject; 2) teachers are tentative in their teaching of
Bible doctrine; 3) leaders hesitate to make decisions on the basis of the Bible; and 4) lay
people are discouraged from reading, studying, and meditating upon the Word of God.
Saddest of all, the ensuing famine for the Word of God (see Amos 8:11-12) has led many to
lose their faith in Jesus Christ, the One to whom all Sripture points (John 5:39; Luke
24:25-27).
This failure to find Jesus Christ can best be appreciated if we return to the earlier analogy
of the person who sits down to a banquet: "The starving man sits down to the banquet once
more. This time he does not probe into the different items on the plate, nor does he try to
speculate on how these items got onto the plate, nor does he try to figure out the cook's
intention in choosing the items and why he arranged them as they are. Rather, he comes to the
food to see what he can add, by way of thinking, to make the food come alive, to give it
meaning. He realizes that he is a co-cook and must apply his human reason to give the real
meaning to this scrumptious feast. He comes to force onto this cooking his cultural ideas of
cooking. After much thought he believes that he has added significantly to the meaning of the
food. With that he gets up and leaves--empty once more. He may claim to be liberated by the
process, but he remains unfed. Why? He ignored the cook who handed him the plate."14
Ellen G. White anticipated this sad situation: "The work of 'higher criticism,' in dissecting,
conjecturing, reconstructing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation; it is
robbing God's word of power to control, uplift and inspire human lives" (Education, p. 227).
The tragedy is that theological pluralism hails this spiritual blindness as a sign of
open-mindedness and scholarly enlightenment!
Impact on the Churches
The doubts which scholars have created regarding the Word of God have seriously
undermined the confidence of average church members in the Bible. Somehow, they have
161
come to believe that the Bible is so full of problems that only the learned scholars can
understand its true meaning. This belief in the alleged obscurity of the Bible is precisely what
Roman Catholicism advanced to argue for the infallibility of the pope. If ordinary church
members cannot understand the Bible, they need an infallible pope to interpret it for them.
Papalism of Scholars. Therefore, to believe in the obscurity of the Bible is to accept a
new form of papalism--the infallibility of scholars, to whom believers must go for biblical
answers. The sixteenth-century reformers rightly rejected this position on the grounds that
papalism replaces the Holy Spirit, Christ's appointed Teacher of the church (John 16:13ff.),
with a fallible human being. To put it differently, this new papalism of scholars denies that
the Holy Spirit is always available to help anyone who is humbly seeking to understand His
inspired Word.
Bible-believing Christians need to be aware of what is at stake in this new papalism.
"Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man in the place of God. He leads the
people to look to bishops, to pastors, to professors of theology, as their guides, instead of
searching the Scriptures to learn their duty for themselves. Then, by controlling the minds of
these leaders, he can influence the multitudes according to his will" (The Great Controversy,
p. 595).
Regrettably, uncertainty over the Bible's authority has trickled down to almost every level
of the church's life. We see this subtle shift from the inspired Book to an inspiring booklet
being played out in many ways:
Practice of Laymembers. Besides the fact that not many people spend time these days
studying and meditating on the Word of God, a casual glance will reveal that fewer and fewer
of our church members even bring their Bibles to church; when they do, they rarely open
them. One reason may be that the Bibles are seldom used in the churches. Fo instance, during
the Sabbath school Bible study hour, many teachers read more from the lesson quarterly than
from the Bible itself. Not too long ago, an editor of the Adventist Review observed: "Too often
I find that what passes for Bible study in many Sabbath school classes is little more than a
rehash of familiar sayings, personal opinion, and Ellen White quotations. It isn't Bible study,
but simply comments about the Bible. . . . Our 'lesson study' has the guise of Bible study, but
it isn't. It is more a study of the Sabbath school lesson quarterly than the Bible."15
Also, during Sabbath school time, when the activities for the day are running late, the
Bible study period of the Sabbath school often is reduced to make time for the seemingly
"more important" programs. In some instances, the weekly Sabbath school Bible study
lessons are ignored, the leaders choosing instead to use the time for "more relevant
contemporary issues." These things reveal our attitudes toward the place of the Bible, not only
in our private devotional lives but also in our corporate church life.
Practice of Ministers. In many minds, worship means listening to a sermon. But
sometimes the preachers are not much help in leading us to the Bible. In fact, they also have
contributed to this growing silence of the Bible, whenever their "preaching" consists of little
more than an assemblage of what they have read from some magazine, author, or newspaper,
or of some "new light" from the prophets of TV talk-show programs. Some preachers who
attempt preaching from the Bible create their own "folk canon," limiting their preaching to
only a few books or sections of the Bible and a few favorite topics. Can you remember the
last time you heard a sermon preached from books such as Leviticus, Chronicles, Obadiah,
Habakkuk, Zechariah, James, Philemon, Jude, or Revelation? Are these books less inspired
than the others?
162
In an effort to appear relevant and up-to-date, some preachers would rather preach about
therapy or healing than about repentance and costly discipleship. The consequence is that
many contemporary sermons--better described as speeches or lectures, or at best
sermonettes--hardly call attention to the "blessed hope" of the second coming or to the
assurance of the pre-advent (investigative) judgment. And why should members study the
Bible if the ministers don't preach from it?
Practice of Musicians. The theological content of music in most Christian churches
reveals this subtle shift from Book to booklet. Many of the songs that were sung in our own
Adventist churches years ago were actually filled with Bible content or themes. Familiar
hymns like "Lift up the Trumpet," "We Know Not the Hour," "Guide Me, O Thou Great
Jehovah," "The Judgment Has Set," etc., are fitting examples.
In much of our contemporary practice, however, we hear more sentimental New Age
music in which Jesus is re-cast as a buddy or a boyfriend, God is increasingly portrayed as an
indulgent Father who will tolerate anything His spoiled children do or want, and the Holy
Spirit is reduced to one's inner self (to use the language from Hindu mystical religion), or
even treated as a cosmic pill to give people a spiritual "high."
Since much contemporary Christian music does not seem to be grounded in sound biblical
teaching,16 it is not surprising that what ought to be an effective vehicle for the proclamation
of the everlasting gospel has become the occasion for the display of individual talent, often
evoking applause as a response. Is this a reason why congregational hymn singing is fading
out in some places?
Practice of Church Leaders. The growing silence of the Bible is also perceptible at the
various levels of the church's decision-making bodies. In some instances, when issues of
doctrine and practice come up for discussion, pragmatic considerations and the authority of
the "vote" tend to hold sway over prayerful and thoughtful consideration of Bible principles.17
It has become convenient to say, "The Bible is silent," in order to avoid dealing with difficult
ethical and theological issues.
Thus, when theological problems arise which threaten to jeopardize God's trth and honor,
some find it more expedient to wish them away with inaction or to let the individual members
or world fields do as they please than to demand a plain "Thus saith the Lord." The courage of
Bible-based convictions is greatly needed in many places.
The Challenge Facing Adventists
The above discussion has highlighted the growing silence of the Bible in Christian
churches. In spite of the increase of pluralism resulting from the erosion of biblical authority,
Seventh-day Adventists must not move with the flow of current trends. "To the law and to the
testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isa
8:20).
What then should the Seventh-day Adventist church do about the pressing theological
issues which currently confront her--issues such as ordination of women, baptizing practicing
polygamists, embracing homosexual lifestyle, divorce and remarriage, and fighting in the
wars of one's tribe or nation? Here are a few suggestions.
1. Subordinate Religious Experience to the Word of God. Increasingly, Christians are
questioning everything in the Bible except what agrees with their subjective religious
experience (often called "the Holy Spirit's leading"). Thus we hear, "The Spirit has called
me"; "the Spirit has assured me"; "the Spirit has accepted me"; and "the Spirit has blessed
163
me."
Experience surely is important in Christianity (1 John 1:1-3). The real issue, however, is
whether experience should have priority over Scripture. The Bible testifies that as important
as even a Spirit-inspired experience may be, the Holy Scriptures are more sure than any
experience.
In Chapter Five we called attention to the apostle Peter's manner of addressing this issue in
2 Peter 1:16-21. In verses 16-18 Peter rejected the claim that the Christian message is a myth
with no objective basis in a factual historical event. As proof, he cited the apostles'
experiential knowledge--"we were eyewitnesses . . . we heard . . . we were with Him."
However, Peter continued in verse 19 by saying that there is something "more sure" than
experience: the prophetic word, the divinely-inspired, authoritative Scriptures (vv. 20-21).
Peter's approach is the very opposite of our pluralistic generation's. In our case, we accept
the Bible because it confirms our experience; the experience is the norm. But the apostle
argues that his sanctified experience is trustworthy because it is confirmed by the Scriptures!
Jesus did something very similar. In explaining His death and resurrection (Luke 24:25-27),
Jesus could have appealed to real experiences--resurrected saints, angels appearing at the
tomb, etc. Instead, He pointed His disciples to "Moses and all the prophets," something "more
sure" than experiences. The men from Emmaus confirmed this, testifying that what caused
their hearts to "burn within" them (v. 32) was Jesus' opening of the Scriptures to them.
Ellen White explained why faith must be established on the Word of God, not one's
subjective experience or feeling: "Genuine faith is founded on the Scriptures; but Satan uses
so many devices to wrest the Scriptures and bring in error, that great care is needed if one
would know what they really do teach. It is one of the great delusions of this time to dwell
much upon feeling, and to claim honesty while ignoring the plain utterances of the word of
God because that word does not coincide with feeling. . . . Feeling may be chaff, but the word
of God is the wheat. And 'what,' says the prophet, 'is the chaff to the wheat?'" (Review and
Herald, November 25, 1884).
2. Recognize that Majority Votes Don't Establish Truth. The quest for political
freedom and democracy has also led increasingly to people demanding a say in matters
affecting their lives. Not surprisingly, some within the church are insisting that Christian
doctrine and lifestyle should also be defined by the will of the people, through referenda,
public opinion polls, surveys, etc.; they seek theology of public opinion, not theology of
biblical revelation.
Despite the values of democracy, Bible-believing Christians need to remind themselves
that Christ is the Head of the church; therefore the decisions of the church must be ratified not
by a mere referendum of its members, but by the authority of the Bible. Leon Morris's helpful
distinction between a church and a democracy is pertinent: "In a democracy there is no
authority but that which arises from within, the will of the people. In a church there is no
authority but that which comes from outside, the will of God. Democracy is effective when
the people are energetic and help themselves, the church when God acts and redeems men."18
3. Govern Ethical Sensitivity by the Bible. Our generation is painfully aware of injustice
and bigotry in our world--racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, apartheid, etc. Because people in the
past have used the Bible to justify these oppressive acts or structures, some biblical scholars
attempt to atone for such prejudice and bigotry by cutting out from the Bible, for all practical
purposes, the sections that offend their ethical sensitivities on equality, fairness, justice,
compassion, etc.
Usually the Old Testament is the target of fierce attack because of the alleged "horror
164
stories" it contains or for its presumed male-centeredness (androcentricity), which supposedly
legitimized a "patriarchal structure" and an anti-women bias.19 Consequently, some
theologians point to societies which have moved beyond racial segregation to integration. On
that analogy, they urge the Christian church to revise its alleged doctrine of "gender
segregation" to allow for gender integration ("inclusiveness"). What they are actually
advocating, though, is the celebration of the values of a unisex society--a community in which
gender barriers in roles, clothing, human sexuality, etc., are eliminated.20
The way to accomplish this is to adopt what one Adventist scholar referred to as a
"hermeneutic of compassion," a method which makes it possible for Christians to ignore,
reject, or reinterpret those "non-Christian" parts of the Bible which offend their ethical
feelings. One extreme example of this effort is the campaign to get rid of the "sexist" or
male-oriented language in the Bible, and to replace it with gender-inclusive expressions
which blur distinctions between male and female: "Lord God" becomes "Sovereign God,"
"heavenly Father" becomes "heavenly Parent," "Son of God" becomes "Child of God,"21 and
the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob becomes "the goddess Sophia."22
This is an old heresy (Marcionism) dressed up in modern clothing. John Bright's response
is pertinent: "I find it most interesting and not a little odd that although the Old Testament on
occasion offends our Christian feelings, it did not apparently offend Christ's 'Christian
feelings'! Could it really be that we are ethically and religiously more sensitive than he? Or is
it perhaps that we do not view the Old Testament--and its God--as he did?"23
4. Have Courage to Stand for Biblical Convictions. Probably the most basic reason for
the subtle shift of attitude from the Bible as an inspired Book to its perception as an inspiring
booklet is the strong pressure on Christians to conform to the contemporary drifts of new
opinions.
"New" has become the operative word on every label; without it, products and ideas
cannot sell. (This reflects the evolutionary theory's view of upward progress.) Who has not
heard about the "New Age Religion" with its "New Theology" and "New Morality" for the
coming "New World Order"? Is it any wonder then, to find "New" Testament Christians who
have experienced the "new birth" and have become "new creatures" expressing in their "new
tongues" their dislike for the "Old" Testamen and the "old" paths?
Response to "New Truths." What then should Bible-believing Christians say in response
to the old heresies being recycled as new truths (or as one Adventist scholar ingeniously calls
them, "present" truths) for today's pluralistic age?
First, what is new is not always true. Sometimes the "new" is something which "has been
already, in the ages before us" (Eccl 1:9, 10); in other cases the "old" is preferable to the
"new" because it is right (Isa 58:12; Jer 6:16). Peter Taylor Forsyth wrote, "I am sure no new
theology can really be theology, whatever its novelty, unless it express[es] and develop[s] the
old faith which made those theologies that are now old the mightiest things of the age when
they were new."24 In other words, new truths should never contradict old truths (Isa 8:19, 20).
Second, Christians must have the moral courage to move against popular tides of
unbiblical opinions. This is neither easy nor palatable, since those who do so are often labeled
and disdained by their peers as uninformed, obscurantist, pre-scientific, intolerant (according
to the canons of pluralism), or even fundamentalist.
In a lecture given in Wycliffe Hall at Oxford University, British scholar Gordon J.
Wenham aptly described the situation: "I suspect that if either you [a student] or your
lecturers discover during your study that you are a Sabellian montanist or semipelagian
gnostic [these were christological heresies in the early church], it will not cause over-much
165
excitement. Such deviants are common place today and in this pluralistic society are usually
accepted without much fuss. However should you be diagnosed as a fundamentalist your fate
may be very different. In the modern theology faculty fundamentalism is the great heresy. It is
regarded as nearly as dangerous as the HIV virus and is treated with similar fervour but with
rather less tact and sympathy."25
Regrettably, Christians who seek the applause of the world rather than the commendation
of God find it more expedient to conform to society's unbiblical norms than to endure
sophisticated intimidation by their peers. And when they conform, the surest way they
maintain an appearance of Christianity is to adopt a hermeneutic that explains away
unpopular biblical positions in a popular new light.
Though the temptation to make the distinctive teachings of the Bible compatible with the
contemporary culture is strong, the Bible warns us against conforming to the world's ideas.
"Be not conformed to this world" (Rom 12:1); "Love not the world, neither the things that are
in the world" (1 John 2:15-17). Martin Luther King, Jr., observed, "We are called to be people
of conviction, not conformity; of moral nobility, not social respectability. We are commanded
to live differently and according to a higher loyalty."26
Daniel E. Pilarczyk, the archbishop of Cincinnati, raised a pertinent question: "If the
church is singing the same tune as everyone else, then who needs the church?"27 If Jeremiah
were living in our day, he would ask the same question that he posed to his contemporaries:
"Now why go to Egypt to drink water from the Shihor? And why go to Assyria to drink water
from the River?" (Jer 2:18 NIV).
Conclusion
We started this chapter by calling attention to the uncertainty of some Christian churches
over such contemporary issues as abortion, homosexuality, polygamy, women's ordination,
divorce and remarriage, fighting in wars, etc. We suggested that this reluctance is a symptom
of the theological pluralism infecting much of Christendom and which has had a devastating
impact onthe life and mission of the church. What is at stake is the nature of the Bible (the
exact nature of its inspiration) and the approach to the Bible (the appropriate method for its
interpretation).
The Bible and the Bible Only. Today the Seventh-day Adventist church also faces these
foundational issues as it grapples with the question of ordaining women as elders and pastors
as well as baptizing practicing polygamists. In deciding which direction to go on these issues,
the church should ensure that these questions not be settled according to the cultural
preferences of each local region of the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist church. Since the
problems are theological rather than sociological, only the Holy Scriptures can have the final
say on the issues at hand. Moreover, in both instances those ordained or baptized must be
accepted whole-heartedly by every Seventh-day Adventist believer; for in a worldwide church
such as we have, ordination and baptism in one division of the world field are automatically
valid for another and should remain that way.
As the church prayerfully considers such questions, it needs to remember the statement by
Ellen G. White: "God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the Bible
only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms. The opinions of learned
men, the deductions of science, the creeds or decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous
and discordant as are the churches which they represent, the voice of the majority--not one
nor all of these should be regarded as evidence for or against any point of religious faith.
Before accepting any doctrine or precept, we should demand a plain 'Thus saith the Lord' in
166
its support" (The Great Controversy, p. 595, emphasis supplied).
Promise for Bible Students. Ellen White assured us: "If all would make the Bible their
study, we should see a people who were better developed, who were capable of thinking more
deeply, who would manifest greater intelligence than those who have earnestly studied the
sciences and histories of the world, apart from the Bible. The Bible gives the true seeker for
truth an advanced mental discipline, and he comes from contemplation of divine things with
his faculties enriched; self is humbled, while God and his revealed truth are exalted" (Bible
Echo and Signs of the Times, October 1, 1892).
This promise is not reserved for the proponents of the so-called "principle-approach" who
claim to possess a "high level of abstract thinking." Instead, it applies to all God's end-time
people, those who seek to live by "the Bible and the Bible only," who are making a diligent
effort to uphold the plain reading or literal understanding of the Bible.
But in order to uphold the Word and not distort it, we must have a clear understanding of
how some are liberating the Word. This we shall take up in the next chapter.

2. The issue of women's ordination is a case in point. Until recently Seventh-day
Adventist proponents of women's ordination had often argued that the Bible was "silent" or
"neither for nor against" the ordination of women as elders/pastors. Thus, they presented the
issue as a "cultural" problem to be settled by administrative policy. However, since the 1995
General Conference session at Utrecht, some have argued that women's ordination is a "moral
imperative"--suggesting that the issue is theological after al, even as opponents have insisted
all along. For more on this, see Samuel Koranteng-Pipim's unpublished article, "Women's
Ordination: The Evolving Arguments" (1996), available at the Adventist Heritage Center of
the James White Library, Andrews University. Now that both proponents and opponents of
women's ordination claim the Bible to be on their side, the hermeneutical questions raised in
chapter 5, part II, can be discussed candidly.

more numerous gradations and distinctions of meaning than perhaps any other in the whole of
theology. There is an inspiration of superintendence and an inspiration of suggestion; an
inspiration that would have been consistent with the Apostle or Evangelist falling into error,
[and] an inspiration which would have prevented him from erring; verbal organic inspiration
by which the inspired person is the passive utterer of Divine word, and an inspiration which
acts through the character of the sacred writer; there is an inspiration which absolutely
communicates the fact to be revealed or statement to be made, and an inspiration which does
not supersede the ordinary knowledge of human event; there is an inspiration which demands
infallibility in matters of doctrine, but allows for mistakes in fact. Lastly there is a view of
inspiration which recognizes only its supernatural and prophetic character, and a view of
inspiration which regards the apostles and evangelists as equally inspired in their writings and
their lives, and in both receiving the guidance of the Spirit of truth in a manner not different in
167
kind but only in degree from ordinary Christians" (Benjamin Jowett, "On the Interpretation of
Scripture," in Essays and Review, n. ed. [London: John W. Parker and Son, 1860], p. 345).

Chapter Eight
Liberating the Word
The Bible was originally given in ancient Middle-Eastern cultures, in languages foreign to
most people today. Bible-believing Christians have always maintained that in order for the
Scriptures to function as the "liberating Word of God," there is a need for "liberating the
Word" from its ancient historical, cultural, and grammatical context. But they also insist that
this process of "liberating the Word" through translation, printing, and interpretation should
not involve imposing today's ideological concerns upon inspired Scripture.
Historical-critical scholarship, on the other hand, believes that in order for the inspired
Word to be liberating, the Bible must first be "liberated" from its alleged inherent
shortcomings. To make the Bible "relevant," they diminish Scripture's authority from the
liberating Word, through the process of liberating the Word, to what liberal scholarship
considers as the liberated Word.1 Thus, in "liberating the Word," different liberal groups
introduce several distortions into the Bible's message.
Attempts to Liberate the Word. For example, classical liberal theology tries to "liberate
the Word" from its alleged historical, scientific, theological, and ethical mistakes; social
gospel theology seeks to "liberate the Word" from its alleged abstract doctrinal interpretations
to today's concrete social and political contexts; feminist theology wants to "liberate the
Word" from its alleged patriarchal worldview, sexist language, and patriarchal God-talk; gay
(homosexual) theology attempts to "liberate the Word" from its alleged homophobic bias so
that it will show compassion and understanding; liberation theology, black theology, and
third-world theologies endeavor to "liberate the Word" from the one-sided, white
middle-class, privatized interpretation that has enslaved, colonized, and exploited the poor,
the people of color, and the marginalized; and experiential theology undertakes to "liberate
the Word" from dry, wooden, and lifeless interpretation void of the Holy Spirit.2
In view of the different ideological agendas that come into play in the process of liberating
the Word, our generation is witnessing some of the grossest abuses of the Word imaginable.
The distortion of the Word at the hands of church members, teachers, pastors, and scholars
raises serious doubts about their claim to uphold the Word as the inspired, trustworthy, and
authoritative revelation of God's will for humanity.
Even though Receiving the Word is concerned with how historical-critical interpreters have
distorted the Word, we need to discuss other possible distortions of the Word from the
moment the Bible writers penned their original messages (the inspired autographs), through
the transmission and translation of the text, to its contemporary interpretation.
The Inspired Writers of "the Liberating Word":
No Distortions of the Word
We have noted earlier that even though the Bible was written in an imperfect human
language, imperfect in the sense that "infinite ideas cannot be perfectly embodied in finite
vehicles of thought" (Selected Messages, 1:22), God supernaturally guided the inspired
writers of Scripture in such a way that they communicated God's message in an accurate and
trustworthy manner. When, therefore, the Bible writers describe something touching upon
science, history, geography, etc., as actually taking place, we are to believe it as trustworthy.

Thus, there was no distortion of the Word when the Bible writers wrote their messages.
The Holy Spirit guided them, not allowing their personal or cultural prejudices to distort
the God-given message. Rejecting any suggestion that their messages were "culturally
conditioned," the apostle Peter wrote: "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is
of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but
holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Pet 1:20-21). "For we have
not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty" (2 Pet 1:16; cf. 1 Cor
2:10-13).
Scripture's Trustworthiness. Ellen G. White affirmed the trustworthiness of the Bible's
historical accounts, since the Holy Spirit "guided the pens of the sacred historians" in such a
manner that "the Bible is the most instructive and comprehensive history that has ever been
given to the world. . . . Here we have a truthful history of the human race, one that is
unmarred by human prejudice or human pride" (Gospel Workers, p. 286; Fundamentals of
Christian Education, pp. 84-85; cf. Education, p. 173).
There are no distortions in the biographies and history of God's favored people for, in the
words of Ellen White, "this history the unerring pen of inspiration must trace with exact
fidelity" (Testimonies for the Church, 4:370). Whereas uninspired historians are unable to
record history without bias, the inspired writers "did not testify to falsehoods to prevent the
pages of sacred history being clouded by the record of human frailties and faults. The scribes
of God wrote as they were dictated by the Holy Spirit, having no control of the work
themselves. They penned the literal truth, and stern, forbidding facts are revealed for reasons
that our finite minds cannot fully comprehend" (ibid., p. 9).
Even the Bible's science is authentic. "Its sacred pages contain the only authentic account
of the creation. . . . There is harmony between nature and Christianity; for both have the same
Author. The book of nature and the book of revelation indicate the working of the same
divine mind" (Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 84-85).
"Inferences erroneously drawn from facts observed in nature have, however, led to
supposed conflict between science and revelation; and in the effort to restore harmony,
interpretations of Scripture have been adopted that undermine and destroy the force of the
Word of God." Ellen White rejected naturalistic evolution and the long ages of geology.
"Geology has been thought to contradict the literal interpretation of the Mosaic record of the
creation. Millions of years, it is claimed, were required for the evolution of the earth from
chaos; and in order to accommodate the Bible to this supposed revelation of science, the days
o creation are assumed to have been vast, indefinite periods, covering thousands or even
millions of years. Such a conclusion is wholly uncalled for. The Bible record is in harmony
with itself and with the teaching of nature" (Education, pp. 128-129).
Thus, any distortion in the Bible's message would not come from the Bible writers
themselves who were guided in their writing of Scripture. We should not expect distortions in
the Word as it came from the hands of the Bible writers. Any distortions will have to come,
not from the original copies (the autographs which no longer exist), but rather from either
copyists and translators as they transmitted the sacred texts or from contemporary interpreters
in their effort to understand the inspired message.
Copyists' and Translators' "Liberating the Word":
Minor Distortions of the Word
While no distortions came from the hand of the original Bible writers, some alterations and
171
minor distortions have crept into the Word during the process of transmission and
translation.3 This section will attempt to show the nature of these minor distortions at the hand
of copyists and translators.
The Old Testament section of our Bibles is a translation of manuscripts that were
originally written in Hebrew, with a few portions of Ezra (4:8-6:18; 7:12-26), Daniel
(2:4-7:28) and a single verse in Jeremiah (10:11) written in Aramaic. Aramaic is a sister
language to Hebrew, just as Swedish is to Norwegian. The New Testament section of our
Bibles is a translation from manuscripts originally written in Greek. Since we do not have
authentic autographs from the hands of the Bible writers themselves, our Bibles represent, at
best, handwritten copies of the original writings (manuscripts). Most likely, they are made
from copies of copies, or maybe copies of copies of copies. And for most church members,
these copies are available only as translations.
Remarkable Accuracy. In an earlier chapter, Trusting the Word, we noted how very
accurately the manuscripts of both the Old and New Testaments were copied and transmitted.
But whenever the inspired texts of Scripture are copied or translated into other languages
there is always the possibility that some alterations and minor distortions of the Word will
take place. Ellen White confirmed this possibility, suggesting that there may have been
occasional errors or even deliberate text manipulations by some copyists (Selected Messages,
1:16; Early Writings, pp. 220-221).4
However, scholars generally agree that these transmission errors can be identified by the
discipline known as textual criticism, sometimes called lower criticism to distinguish it from
the higher criticism of liberal scholars. By analyzing and evaluating the various ancient
manuscripts, this scholarly discipline seeks to ascertain which reading of a passage is closest
to the original.
Distortions by Copyists
Old Testament Manuscripts (MSS). The Jews did a magnificent job in copying the Old
Testament manuscripts. Until the temple was destroyed in A.D. 70, the Jews kept standard
copies of the Scriptures in the temple in Jerusalem, just as we keep standard weights and
measurements in museums. In order that all copies of the Old Testament would conform to
the standard copy in the temple, strict rules were followed.
As we noted in Chapter Two, the Massoretes, the group of Jews who around A.D. 700
invented a system for writing Hebrew vowels, drew up tables, one for each book of the Bible,
showing how many times a particular letter appeared n that book. No word or letter could be
written from memory. After a scribe had finished his work of copying out a book, he had to
count the letters in it and compare his scores with those in the standard table. If his did not
tally with the standard score, his newly copied manuscript was to be discarded entirely and
the task begun again. This process ensured remarkable accuracy.
But human nature being what it is, one wonders if a scribe would scrap a whole book if he
fell short by one or two letters in his count. One can expect some deliberate textual
manipulations in such instances. Some minor distortions may also have occurred
unintentionally.
Nature of Old Testament Errors. Problems occurred when a change of vowels resulted in
a change of meaning. Let's illustrate with the English word LEAD. Prior to the invention of
written vowels for Hebrew around A.D. 700, if there were a word LEAD, this word would
have been spelled in Hebrew as LD. Now, lead can have at least two meanings. There is one
172
meaning in the sentence "lead me home," and another in "heavy as lead." If different vowels
are attached to these two consonants, one can come up with words like lead, lid, lad, led, laid,
lied, load, loud, old. In deciding what word LD should be, the context of a passage is helpful.
But sometimes, the context can go either way. For example, "LD me home" can be rendered
"lead me home," "led me home," "laid me home," or even "load me home"! Assuming we try
the other sentence "heavy as LD" one can translate it as "heavy as lead," "heavy as [a] lad,"
or "heavy as [a] load." One can imagine other different ways LD can be read.
Fortunately, written Hebrew does not depend as heavily on vowels as English does. The
Massoretes, fluent in Hebrew, had very little difficulty reading without written vowels--just as
Israelis today read their newspapers without vowels.
Also, since a number of Hebrew letters resemble other letters closely, a copyist could make
scribal mistakes. For example, we find the names Hadadezer (2 Sam 8:3) and Hadarezer (1
Chron 18:3) referring to the same person. The difference here is the Hebrew letter "d" ( d )
being mistaken for the letter "r" ( r ). We can understand a copyist's blunder when we realize:
(i) how much alike some words look in the Hebrew--e.g., Zabdi ( ydbz, Josh 7:1) and Zimri (
yrmz, 1 Chron 2:6); or (ii) how easy it is for letters to be transposed, as we do when we write
"thier" instead of "their"; in the Old Testament, we find, for example, instead of Hasrah, the
name of a person, we have Harhas; instead of kebes, the word for a lamb, we have keseb;
instead of algum, the name of a tree, we have almug; instead of Timnath-heres, the name of
the city where Joshua was buried, we have Timnath-serah.
The above examples illustrate the distortions that have arisen during the transmission of
the Old Testament manuscripts.
Remarkable Accuracy. However, in spite of problems like these, the Old Testament
manuscripts exhibit remarkable accuracy. Until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947,
the oldest known Hebrew manuscripts had been copied around the tenth century A.D. The
Dead Sea Scrolls, however, were hidden away in caves just before A.D. 70, when the Romans
invaded Palestine. Many of them were already one or two hundred years old at the time.
Doubts about the reliability of the tenth-century manuscripts were dispelled when they
were compared with the Dead Sea Scrolls, a thousand years older. One leading authority
remarks: "The new evidence confirms what we had already good reason to believe--that the
Jewish scribes of the early Christian centuries copied and recopied the text of the Hebrew
Bible with the utmos fidelity."5 In all likelihood our Old Testament is remarkably similar to
the Old Testament Bible Jesus used.
New Testament Manuscripts. The copyists of the New Testament did not match those of
the Old in terms of high standards. This does not mean that the manuscripts of the New
Testament are bad, but only that the quality controls in place for the Old Testament were not
there. A few of the copyists' distortions will illustrate this point.6
Nature of New Testament Errors. If a New Testament copyist was writing down what was
being read to him by another, he might hear something incorrectly and therefore make a
mistake. For instance, the manuscript variants in Romans 5:1 may result from a copyist
hearing echomen ("we have") instead of echomen ("let us have"). Similarly, because the
pronunciation of ou and u is often indistinguishable, we may understand why there are
variants in Revelation 1:5. Thus, whereas the King James Version (KJV) reads "and washed
us," based on a manuscript that reads lousanti, other versions, such as the New International
Version (NIV), on the basis of other manuscripts that read lusanti, have "and freed us."
Again, similarity in pronunciation may explain the discrepancies in the manuscripts of 1
John 1:4. Did the apostle John write his letter so that "our joy" may be complete (NIV, RSV)
173
or in order that "your joy" may be full (KJV)? The Greek pronouns hemeis ("we") and humeis
("you"), when inflected to express possession ("our" and "your," respectively), were
pronounced very much alike, a fact reflected in variant manuscripts.
On the other hand, if instead of listening to a reader, a scribe was reading and copying a
manuscript by himself, several kinds of inadvertent errors could occur. One of them happens
when there are similar endings of lines or words (the technical name for this kind of copyist
error is homoeoteleuton). A scribe copies what he sees, but when his eyes return to the parent
manuscript, he mistakenly skips to the second of these similar items, leaving out some
material; or he might copy the same line twice when his eyes skip back to the earlier
occurrence.
Other errors include intentional changes, either for the copyist's own personal or
theological reasons, or when he thought he was correcting the mistakes of a preceding scribe,
whom he believed may have made some mistakes in grammar, vocabulary, or spelling. Ellen
White noted: "I saw that God had especially guarded the Bible; yet when copies of it were
few, learned men had in some instances changed the words, thinking that they were making it
more plain, when in reality they were mystifying that which was plain, by causing it to lean to
their established views, which were governed by tradition" (Early Writings, pp. 220-221).
Sometimes, a scribe had several manuscripts from which he made his copy. If he
discovered that the manuscripts read differently, he made a judgment by either choosing one
reading and leaving the other, or in some cases, putting the two together to make a conflated
reading. Thus, if a manuscript has "church of God" in Acts 20:28, and others have "church of
the Lord," a later copyist, who wants to provide readers with the benefit of the two readings,
may conflate the two to produce "church of the Lord and God."
Reasons for New Testament Errors. Generally, the New Testament copyists were not as
rigorous in their work as were the scribes of the Old Testament writings. Unlike the
well-trained Jewish scribes who copied the Old Testament so meticulously, the early
Christian believers often came from the lower classes and lacked the professional skill of the
scribe. Consequently, the few who could read and write produced copies of the inspired
autographs with little or no proofreading.
Moreover, persecution and confiscations of their sacred books often led them to copy the
texts hastily. Heretical groups also made their own copies, sometimes deleting portions and
mutilating others. Only after emperor Constantine (A.D. 274/80-337) was converted to
Christianity were there enough freedom and resources for Christianscarefully to copy and
proofread manuscripts. Because most of the New Testament manuscripts that exist today
came from this Byzantine period, they are referred to collectively as the Byzantine text.
Compensating for Disadvantages. The disadvantages of the New Testament manuscripts,
however, are offset by their numbers. There are far more New Testament than Old Testament
manuscripts from which one can make comparisons. About 5,000 separate manuscripts of the
Greek New Testament exist in the different museums and libraries around the world. While
some are only fragments, about 50 contain the entire New Testament.
Besides, many early copies were translated into other languages. Some 6,000 Latin
manuscripts have survived, plus about 1,000 other manuscripts in languages such as Syriac,
Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, and Gothic. Further, large parts of the New Testament
are quoted in early Christian writings.7 The sheer quantity and reliability of the New
Testament manuscripts far exceed any other historical material that has survived from
antiquity.8
Remarkable Accuracy. When one recognizes the conditions under which the New
Testament manuscripts were copied and the fact that the copyists did not have the advantages
of printing presses and computer spell-checkers, it is remarkable to find among the existing
174
manuscripts a 99.9% accuracy. Even where there are variations, most concern specific words
where the scribes made copying mistakes. So accurate are the New Testament manuscripts
that someone has estimated that if all the uncertain words in a five-hundred page Greek
Testament were assembled, they would occupy only four-tenths of a single page!9 That is, the
uncertain words from the different existing manuscripts are only about 0.08% of a 500-page
book.
Even here, this insignificant percentage is possible only by assuming that the ending of
Mark (16:9-20) and the passage about the woman taken in adultery (John 7:53-8:11) were not
part of the autographs. But if one accepts these passages as part of the original text (they
appear in some 99% of Greek manuscripts, and they are attested in numerous places in the
writings of Ellen G. White10), the purity of the New Testament manuscripts is even higher.11
Though variations may allow us to speak only of a high degree of relative accuracy of the
texts, the differences are so minor that no viable variant affects any major Christian doctrine.
One knowledgeable scholar states: "What is at stake is a purity of text of such a substantial
nature that nothing we believe to be doctrinally true, and nothing we are commanded to do, is
in any way jeopardized by the variants. This is true of any textual tradition [family of
texts]."12
Divine Guidance in Transmission Process. Such remarkable accuracy is possible only if
the Holy Spirit guided the transmission process. Ellen White confirmed that even though
scribes may have made some copying mistakes, God Himself guarded the transmission
process so that the Bible is God's trustworthy book. "This Holy Book has withstood the
assaults of Satan, who has united with evil men to make everything of divine character
shrouded in clouds and darkness. But the Lord has preserved this Holy Book by His own
miraculous power in its present shape" (Selected Messages, 1:15, emphasis supplied).
Probably the Lord kept the original manuscripts from us so that we would not make
shrines or idols of them. But as further manuscripts are found buried in ruins or in forgotten
monasteries, and as computer technology is refined to analyze existing various manuscripts,
we may yet establish even more reliable texts than the 99.9% accurate texts from which most
of our present Bibles have been translated.
The minor nature of the alterations and distortions that have occurred in the transmission
of the inspired Bible messages suggests that whenever Bible students study their Hebrew and
Greek Bibles, they can count on these texts to convey the message God inspired thousands of
years ago. The example of Jesus and the apostles in treating copies of the Old Testament as
"Scripture" (Greek graphe) teaches s to do the same.
Although the autographs no longer existed, Christ read from "Scripture" (graphe) in the
synagogue at Nazareth (Luke 4:21); Paul read from "Scripture" (graphe) in the synagogue in
Thessalonica (Acts 17:2); the Ethiopian eunuch was reading "Scripture" (graphe) when Philip
met him (Acts 8:32-33); and the apostle Paul writes that the "Scriptures" (graphe) that were
being used by believers in his day are all inspired (2 Tim 3:16). These copies were not the
autographs; no doubt they contained some scribal errors. Yet the Bible calls the copies
"Scripture" (graphe).
Therefore, Bible students who are able to read and understand copies of the Hebrew and
Greek Bibles can be quite sure that they are studying essentially the same Old Testament
Hebrew text that Jesus used and the New Testament Greek text that the Spirit of Christ
inspired the apostles to write. In the words of Ellen White, "The Bible is the most ancient and
the most comprehensive history that men possess. It came fresh from the fountain of eternal
truth, and throughout the ages a divine hand has preserved its purity" (Education, p. 173,
emphasis supplied).
175
Distortions from Translators
Since very few of us can read and understand the Bible's original languages, we must rely
on translations. But every translation of the Bible is an interpretation. In order for the inspired
message to be understood, the translator must put the biblical message in a form that will
produce the same effect on the contemporary reader as it did on the original recipients of the
inspired message.
In some cases, a literal, word-for-word translation (called formal or complete
equivalence13), in which the grammatical structure of the original language is reproduced as
much as possible in the receiving language, may be hard to understand. In order for the text to
be clearer, one must rephrase the message without losing the original intent (this is referred to
as dynamic equivalence). However, those who do oral translations for speakers will readily
admit that, despite their best intentions, there are occasional distortions in the message. These
translation losses and translation distortions may not necessarily be the fault of the
translators.14
Kinds of Translation Distortions. While the distortions of the Word that were introduced
by copyists of the ancient biblical manuscripts were minor (less than 0.1%), Bible
translations or paraphrases introduce their own kinds of distortions in the message of the
inspired writers. Not infrequently, these errors stem from how translators embark upon their
task. Translators introduce two major kinds of errors.
First, some translation errors result from the assumptions the translators bring with them.
For example, errors may creep into the biblical message if translators are driven by some
hidden or explicit theological or ideological agenda. One can point to the New World
Translation (the Jehovah's Witnesses' Bible) as a translation driven by the anti-Trinitarian
theology of a religious group. Another example is the National Council of Churches'
gender-inclusive Bible, the New Revised Standard Version [NRSV], which, despite some
strengths, is driven by a desire to rid the Bible of the alleged gender-bias of the Bible writers.
The same can be said of certain other translations in which references to the "right hand" of
God have been replaced with "the mighty hand" of God, in an apparent effort not to offend
left-handed people!15
Second, distortions in translations occur if translators use faulty, questionable, or too few
Greek and Hebrew manuscripts as the basis for their translations, or if they do their work
without much input from a wide range of people. This point puts in better perspective the
debate about the King James Version (KJV) vis-a-vis modern translations.
The King James Version. Our popular King James Version Bible is based on the work of
the foremost sixteenth-century Renaissance Dutch scholar, Desiderius Erasmus (1469-1536).
To produce a copy of the New Testament text for publication on the newly estalished
movable-type printing press, Erasmus went to Basel, Switzerland, where, upon examining a
number of Greek manuscripts in its libraries, he selected a half-dozen of them as good
representatives. After nine months of work, he produced an edited version from the chosen
Greek manuscripts.
Although Erasmus himself acknowledged that his work was "done headlong rather than
edited," his Greek New Testament became the standard, almost the sole printed Greek text
from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth. It is often known as "the Received Text" (Latin,
Textus Receptus), a title given to it almost 100 years after Erasmus's death in publisher
Elzevir's second edition of the work (1633). This Greek text, which later became the basis of
176
the King James Version of the Bible, "is not the 'received text' in the sense that it has been
received from God as over against other Greek manuscripts. Rather, it is the 'received text' in
the sense that it was the standard one at the time of the Elzevirs."16
However, since the nineteenth century, when scholars began to discover other manuscripts,
many translations of the Bible have been made. Unlike the King James Version, most of the
recent translations did not use only a half-dozen Greek manuscripts, but rather hundreds of
early manuscripts; their Greek texts required not nine months of work, but rather years of
labor; not one person, but dozens and scores of scholars have collaborated in producing the
current standard Greek New Testament texts.
While there are variations, the differences between "the Received Text" of the King James
Version and the present standard Greek texts are so minor that there is practically very little
difference between the two. As explained earlier, if the uncertain words in a five-hundred
page Greek Testament were assembled, they would occupy only four-tenths of a single page!
Therefore, while the controversy over the merits and demerits of the King James Version
cannot be dismissed lightly, neither should the issue be over-exaggerated. The degree of
uncertainty raised by the various Greek texts is far less than the distortions introduced by
contemporary interpreters.17
Usefulness of Different Versions. Just as the Holy Spirit guided in the copying and
re-copying of the ancient texts, one can also expect the Spirit to speak through the different
translations--whether King James Version, New International Version, Revised Standard
Version, New World Translation, Living Bible, Clear Word, etc.
Every translation is an imperfect human attempt to communicate, in contemporary
language, God's message which the prophets and apostles first communicated in Hebrew,
Aramaic, and Greek. Each Bible translation has its own strengths and weaknesses. One can
overcome most of the translation distortions simply by using different Bible versions in
studying the Scriptures.18 In the next chapter we shall offer suggestions on how to select
appropriate Bible versions.
Those who are distressed by the proliferation of Bible versions will benefit from an
insightful statement found in the preface of some of the earliest editions of the King James
Version:
"We do not deny, nay we affirm and avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in
English set forth by men of our profession . . . containeth the word of God, nay is the word of
God: As the King's speech, which he uttered in Parliament, being translated into French,
Dutch, Italian, and Latin, is still the King's speech, though it be not interpreted by every
translator with the like grace, nor peradventure so fitly for phrase, nor so expressly for sense,
everywhere . . . [there is] no cause therefore why the word translated should be denied to be
the word, or forbidden to be current, notwithstanding that some imperfections and blemishes
may be noted in the setting forth of it."19
Translations are Also Scripture. In fact, when the New Testament writers quoted from
the Old Testament, they seem to have used Greek translations of the Hebrew Scriptures (the
Septuagint, abbreviated LXX).20 If translations of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, however
imperfect the translation may have been, are treated by the New Testament writers as
"Scripture" (graphe), contemporary Bible students can also treat whatever versions of the
Bible they have--whether English, Swahili, Chinese, Russian, Yoruba, French, Spanish,
etc.--as God's inspired message to them.
Bible students need not be overly concerned about distortions of the Word at the hands of
copyists or translators. Ellen White speaks to this issue when she wrote:
177
"Some look to us gravely and say, 'Don't you think there might have been some mistake in
the copyist or in the translators?' This is all probable, and the mind that is so narrow that it
will hesitate and stumble over this possibility or probability would be just as ready to stumble
over the mysteries of the Inspired Word, because their feeble minds cannot see through the
purposes of God. Yes, they would just as easily stumble over plain facts that the common
mind will accept, and discern the Divine, and to which God's utterance is plain and beautiful,
full of marrow and fatness. All the mistakes will not cause trouble to one soul, or cause any
feet to stumble, that would not manufacture difficulties from the plainest revealed truth"
(Selected Messages, 1:16, emphasis supplied).
Bible students must be more concerned about the distortions of the Word that result when
they themselves grossly misinterpret the inspired Word.
Contemporary Interpreters Produce "the Liberated Word":
Gross Distortions of the Word
The minor distortions of the Word by copyists and translators can be corrected and
controlled by comparing their work with available manuscripts and other versions of the
Bible. However, with interpreters (or exegetes) there is a greater likelihood of a gross abuse
of the Word. This is because interpreters (church members, teachers, or preachers) may have
no controls to regulate their interpretations.
The grossest distortions of the Word occur at the level of interpretation. This is because
interpreters tend to approach the Word with their own agenda, seeking to "liberate the Word."
Such distortions happen at the two major levels of interpretation: (i) at the popular churchly
level, and (ii) at the scholarly academic level.
Popular Distortion: Relevance as Interpretation
One common kind of biblical distortion takes place at the popular level, when Bible
students (church members and pastors) confuse interpretation with relevance or
meaningfulness. Here, instead of first ascertaining what a text originally meant and then,
using valid principles, applying the meaning to contemporary needs, Bible students seek to
read into the text what they believe the text means to them.
Thus, they impose upon the scriptural passage their own meanings or opinions,
transforming biblical exposition into a proof-text imposition. In other words, exegesis
(reading out of the text meaning that is already there) becomes eisegesis (reading into the text
meaning that is not there). This error is very subtle.
To illustrate how Scripture is distorted when believers attempt to apply the Bible to their
lives without regard to what the Scripture really means, we shall look at two familiar areas of
church life where such distortion often takes place.
Distortion by Bible Students. At a typical Bible study, whether Sabbath School class or
small group meeting at the home, someone reads a short verse or passage. The leader then
asks: "What does this passage mean to you?" to which several respond with whatever
thoughts come to their minds. Very few, if any, have had the time to study th passage ahead
of time. Since the leader seeks to encourage everyone, he affirms each one by expressing
delight in their spiritual insights. What may not be readily obvious to many is that Bible study
has been transformed to a pooling of the ignorance and opinions of people about the Bible!
The problem with this popular approach to Scripture is that it identifies relevance as
interpretation. Notice that the leader really asked the wrong question. The Bible passage read
178
was first directed to a particular individual or groups of individuals at a certain time and
place, by a certain inspired writer or speaker, for a specific purpose. Instead of asking "What
does the passage mean to you?" is it not first important to ask: "What does the text mean?"
Popular distortions of Scripture can be ridiculous. Recently, I read the following account:
"I watched in horror a couple of years ago as a guest on a charismatic television network
explained the 'biblical basis' of his ministry of 'possibility thinking.' 'My ministry is based
entirely on my life verse, Matthew 19:26, With God all things are possible. God gave me that
verse because I was born in 1926.'
"Obviously intrigued by that method of obtaining a 'life verse,' the talk show host grabbed
a Bible and began thumbing through excitedly. 'I was born in 1934,' he said. 'My life verse
would be Matthew 19:34. What does it say?' Then he discovered that Matthew 19 has only
thirty verses. Undeterred, he flipped to Luke 19 and read verse 34: And they said, the Lord
hath need of him (KJV).
"Thrilled, he exclaimed, 'Oh, the Lord has need of me! The Lord has need of me! What a
wonderful life verse! I've never had a life verse before, but now the Lord has given me one!
Thank you, Jesus! Hallelujah!' The studio audience began to applaud.
"At that moment, however, the talk show host's wife, who had also turned to Luke 19, said,
'Wait a minute! You can't use this. This verse is talking about a donkey!'"21
Such distortions are not limited to charismatics. The story aptly illustrates the willy-nilly
way some church members approach Scripture. Seeking for something that seems applicable
to whatever trial or need they are facing, some Bible students use Scripture in this manner.
While God can speak through donkeys and even stones, studying the Bible in this way is not
how to ascertain "a word from the Lord."
Distortion by Bible Teachers and Preachers. Some pastors, preachers, and teachers are
also guilty of this "the Lord gave me this verse" abuse of Scriptures, though they may often
give the appearance of being faithful to the Word. But just as some believers distort the Word
by seeking the contemporary meaning of the Bible without regard to its historical, cultural,
and grammatical meaning, so also do these pastors, preachers, and teachers use the Bible
merely as a launching pad to recycle their opinions. What often parades as biblical teaching
and preaching in today's churches is more of form, rhetoric, and antics than of substance.
To give the impression that they are explaining the Bible, these teachers and preachers
may sprinkle a few Greek and Hebrew words on some selected Bible texts, and having
performed this ceremonial rite, they launch into: (i) moralistic advice or pep-talks on some
techniques of modern psychological therapy, (ii) a rousing speech on politics or some other
ideological fad, (iii) a pursuit of comedy, theatrics or even occultic exorcisms of alleged
demonic oppression, (iv) creative or moving stories to tickle the ears, or (v) recycled public
opinions or the opinions of experts.
All this is done in the name of "relevance" or of meeting the needs of church members,
with the teachers and preachers thinking that such gimmicks and high-sounding human words
will revitalize the church and cause it to grow. Meanwhile, the world and the church languish
in a great famine for the unadulterated Word of God (cf. Amos 8:11-12).
A Los Angeles Times Magazine article illustrated the results of this famine. A Protestant
church in Southern California distributes flyers advertising their church as "God's Country
Goodtime Hour," with a bold promise: "Lne dancing following worship." The reporter wrote:
"The pastor is dancing, too, decked out in Wrangler boots and Levis." She continued:
"Members listen to sermons whose topics include the pastor's '70 Ford pickup, and Christian
sex (rated R for 'relevance, respect, and relationship . . . and more fun than it sounds'). After
service, they dance to a band called--what else?--Honkytonk Angels. Attendance has been
179
steadily rising."22
The apostle Paul had the solution to today's problem: "I charge thee therefore before God,
and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his
kingdom. Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with
all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound
doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch
thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy
ministry" (2 Tim 4:1-5, emphasis supplied).
Diminishing Popular Distortions. Sound principles of Bible interpretation (hermeneutics)
can reduce some of the distortions of the Word. By studying the Bible in its historical,
grammatical and literary context, comparing Scripture with Scripture, we can come to a better
understanding of what a text meant to its original readers. Only as we understand what a text
meant to its writer and original recipients can we be in a position to know what it means for
us today.
In the next chapter we shall show that "rightly dividing the Word" means avoiding
spiritualizing or allegorizing the Bible in the name of relevance or meaningfulness. We must
first ascertain the historical-grammatical meaning of Scripture, and from there proceed to
draw valid principles for contemporary application.
Scholarly Distortion: Evaluation as Interpretation
The scholars' most common form of scriptural distortion is viewing interpretation as
evaluation. Rather than simply seeking to understand what the Bible writer said or wrote,
such scholars think that they must declare whether a given passage is truthful, ethical, or
factually accurate.
Scholars thus impose upon the Bible passage their own assumptions or presuppositions
regarding what constitutes truthfulness, right and wrong, or factual accuracy, and on these
assumptions they reconstruct the Bible, distorting biblical exposition into an ideological
imposition.
In other words, in the scholarly approach (the historical-critical method), what should have
been a sound exegesis (reading out of the biblical text what is already there) is reduced to a
dubious eisegesis (reading into the biblical text what is not there). In this respect, both the
scholarly approach and the popular approach are expressions of the proof-text method. They
differ only in kind and degree.
To understand how scholars are manufacturing difficulties from the plainest revealed
truths of Scripture, imposing their unbiblical assumptions on Scripture, we shall need to take
a look at their attitude toward the Bible and the kinds of doubts they raise concerning its
inspired message.
The Critical Scholars and the Bible
In the Seventh-day Adventist church, just as in other Bible-believing conservative
churches, criticism of the Bible is carried out by moderate liberals. As we explained in
Chapter Three, moderate liberalism or accommodationism is old-fashioned liberalism in new
and respectable garb: "The only significant difference between the new Liberalism and the
old seems to be that the former lays more stress than did the latter on the importance of
believing the more or less mangled Bible that comes out of the critical mincing-machine."23
180
Unlike the classical or radical liberals whose loud critical voices are heard from time to
time in Christian churches, accommodationists are not so radical or vocal in their rejection of
some portions of the Bible. This is why they appeal to many Christians as earnest,
"progressive," and "open-minded" Christians.
They argue eloquently that the Bible is not as simplistic or ordinary as the radical liberals
want people to believe; neither is it wholly trustworthy and dependable as the Bible-believing
Christians want to maintain. But accommodationists are closer to radical liberals than to
Bible-believing conservatives in their views on biblical authority and interpretation.
Biblical Authority. Even though they claim to make the Bible central in their Christian
faith and practice, accommodationists do not take the Bible as the final word on any issue.
The Bible only opens possibilities for its readers, but the determination of what to believe and
practice is the individual's responsibility. The Bible, they claim, does not have answers for
every issue; more often it raises questions.
One non-Adventist accommodationist writer stated: "There is a natural and understandable
human desire to have some authority available to us that would answer all questions. What
God has given us, instead, is a Word which prompts more questions than it answers. In
Scripture, God has uttered for us not the last word but the first--a Word designed to set us off
on a pilgrimage, in pursuit of that life that he has willed for us to have."24
When this author writes that "in Scripture, God has uttered for us not the last word but the
first," he is stating subtly that the Bible is not the sole or normative authority for the Christian.
In this view, Scripture has only a "primary authority" over experience and empirical data.
Biblical Interpretation. Besides their different views on scriptural authority, critical
scholars also differ from Bible-believing scholars in their method of Bible interpretation.
Accommodationists claim to find in the Bible some intrinsic problems such as errors,
contradictions, irrelevance, and even immorality. The preferred terms for the alleged
contradictions and errors in the Bible are "diversities," "differences," and "disturbing details."
According to moderate liberals, such problems should not disturb mature Christians, since
the "discrepancies" or "inaccuracies" inherent in Scriptures are "minor" in comparison to the
Bible's great themes of salvation. Accommodationists explain that just as I consider my wife
to be a good loving wife despite her occasional mistakes, so also the Bible is a good book,
despite its occasional inaccuracies.
If Scripture is not absolutely trustworthy and dependable, how are we to determine when
the Bible is not presenting the truth? Accommodationist scholars answer this question by
appealing to the "assured results" of modern (liberal) scholarship. In other words, they exalt
the findings of historical-critical methodology as the norm by which we can accept or reject
certain portions of the Bible.
But the accommodationist is faced with a dilemma. He wants to be true to the Bible and to
critical methodology at the same time. He wants the acceptance of Bible-believing
conservative Christians, and at the same time, he seeks the respect of liberal theologians. In
the end, he is not truly accepted by either camp.
A Look at Some Bible Difficulties
In order to understand the nature of Scripture's alleged discrepancies, we must look briefly
at some of the assumptions behind accommodationists' claims of error.25 As we did with the
quail problem in Chapter One, in Chapter Ten we shall deal with many of them.
181
The Bible and Modern Science. The Bible's worldview, we are told, conflicts with some
aspects of modern science. Consequently Christians can no longer accept those portions of
Scripture founded on this "pre-scientific" worldview.
These questions are often posed: (1) Can well-meaning Christians still accept a literal
six-day creation when modern science has "clearly and persuasively" shown that the theory of
evolution is more acceptable than divine creation? (2) Since the earth revolves around the sun
and not vice versa, how could the sun have stood still in Joshua's day? (3) How do we prove
the Bible's assertion in Leviticus 11:6 and Deuteronomy 14:7 that hares chew the cud? (4)
How can the circular "sea of cast metal" in Solomon's temple (2 Chron 4:1-2) have a diameter
of 10 cubits and yet have a circumference of 30 cubits, when we know from simple
mathematics that the circumference should be about 31.42 cubits (circumference = p x
diameter, i.e., 3.142 x 10)?
The Bible and Ancient History. Moderate liberals argue that the way in which the Bible
writers wrote their accounts of ancient historical events is no different from the manner in
which historians of every generation report theirs. Even in our age of computers, satellites,
fax machines, and internet communication systems, it is often difficult to ascertain fully the
facts surrounding an event. It is very difficult to explain, for example, what really happened
during the Gulf War and the real reason behind it. Because people may forget, misunderstand,
misinterpret, and even distort events, some suggest that the Bible's historical accounts suffer
the same problems as other histories.
Questions often raised include: (1) Was there ever a worldwide flood in the days of Noah,
as recorded in Genesis 6-8? (2) Did the number of people who left Egypt during the exodus
reach 600,000 men (about 2 million people, if women and children are included)? (3) Did
Caesar Augustus order an empire-wide census while Quirinius was governor over Syria (Luke
2:1-2)?
The Bible and Predictive Prophecy. Critical scholars suggest that whatever Scripture
presents as a prophetic prediction of the future is no prediction after all, since the "open view
of God" in liberal theology does not allow for a God who knows the future. Therefore, Bible
prophecies are dismissed as descriptions of what has already happened presented in the guise
of a prophecy of what will happen (this is known technically as vaticinium ex eventu). This
view also assumes that there can be no miraculous manifestations, including God's ability to
foretell the future; therefore, wherever there are clear evidences of fulfilled prophecies, the
prophecies must have been written after the events actually took place.
Questions associated with this view affect how we date some books of the Bible and how
their prophecies are to be interpreted. For example: Are the five books of Moses to be dated
to the time of Moses or to a later date such as the 10th century B.C. (the time of David and
Solomon), the 9th century (the time of Elijah and Elisha), or the 8th, 7th or 6th centuries or
later (pre-exilic, exilic or even post-exilic times)? Did Daniel the prophet really live and
prophesy in the 6th century B.C. (the time of Babylon) as the Bible says, or did someone else
write the Book of Daniel in the 2nd century B.C. (during the time of Greece), making up
"prophecies" to fit past events?
The Bible and Ethical Morality. Some scholars find certain Bible accounts ethically
repugnant to their individual feelings and moral judgments. It is ironic that our generation,
thriving on violence and lewdness in popular magazines and television, should be repulsed by
certain accounts in the Bible.
Examples often cited include:
182
(1) The morally offensive character and acts of Old Testament figures. Examples include
the lies, cover-ups, immorality, adultery, murder, etc., of Abraham, Jacob, David, Solomon,
and others--people on the Bible's honor roll (Heb 11).
(2) The morally offensive character and acts of God. These include statements in the Bible
in which God is represented as partial, fickle, hateful, vengeful, and otherwise morally
unworthy; God's apparent complicity in the she-bear attack on a group of boys (2 Kings
2:23-25); God's command to Israel to "go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep,
camel and ass" (1 Sam 15:3); God's endorsement of executions of people with other religions
(e.g., Baal worship, witchcraft, sorcery, astrology, etc.), other days of worship than His
seventh-day Sabbath (Ex 22:18, 20; Ex 35:2; Num 15:32-36; Deut 13:1-10), alternate
lifestyles like homosexuality, sex between consenting adults--within or without the marriage
relationship (Lev 20:10-21; Deut 22:20-22), problem children--whether they be incorigible,
delinquent, or disobedient (Deut 17:12; 21:18-21; Ex 21:15; Lev 20:9; Prov 20:20), etc.26
The Bible's Own Alleged Internal Discrepancies. While the previous cases of alleged
errors are ideological in nature, that is to say, the Bible is construed as mistaken on the basis
of the accommodationist's presuppositions on science, history, and ethics, the fourth example
of "inaccuracies" in the Bible is argued on the basis of alleged self-contradictions in the
scriptural text itself.
In a court of law, a lack of confidence in the credibility of a witness can result in
dismissing the witness's testimony in important matters. Thus, if it can be shown from the
Bible itself that it contains discrepancies, contradictions, and errors, however minor or
inconsequential they may be, then one may more easily reject any other part of the Bible,
including doctrinal and theological parts.
For example, one can easily dismiss the Bible's condemnation of homosexuality if it can be
proved that the Bible is mistaken on some issues and therefore may be mistaken in its
condemnation of homosexuality. Similarly, if one can disregard the creation basis of the
Bible's teaching of male headship, why can't one also ignore the seventh-day Sabbath, since it
is also rooted in creation?27
The kinds of questions raised by the Bible's alleged internal discrepancies include: Where
was Jacob finally buried? Was it at Shechem, in the tomb of Abraham (Acts 7:16) or at
Hebron (Gen 50:13; cf. 23:19)? Who is telling the truth regarding the motivation, the exact
number, the personalities, and costs involved in David's census? Is it 2 Samuel 24 or 1
Chronicles 21?
Further, which of the four gospel writers should be trusted when there are apparent
discrepancies between their accounts? For example, which genealogy of Christ is correct,
Matthew 1 or Luke 3? How many demoniacs met Jesus at Gadara--one (Mark 5:2 and Luke
8:27) or two (Matt 8:28)? How many blind men were healed in Jesus' encounter with
Bartimaeus--one (Mark 10:46 and Luke 18:35) or two (Matt 20:30)? Did Jesus instruct his
disciples to take a staff on their preaching mission (Mark 6:8) or did he specifically prohibit
the taking of a staff (Matt 10:9-10; Luke 9:3)? How many times did the cock crow (Matt
26:74; Luke 22:60; John 18:27; Mark 14:72)? How many angels were at Christ's tomb on the
resurrection morning--one (Matt 28:5 and Mark 16:5) or two (Luke 24:4 and John 20:12)?
In a later chapter we shall wrestle with the Word regarding some of these alleged errors or
contradictions of the Bible. Before doing so, however, we shall first highlight some
implications these so-called discrepancies may have for the authority and reliability of
Scriptures. For if these questions are valid, they suggest that the Bible writers were not
always truthful or accurate in what they wrote.
183
Implications of Alleged Discrepancies
Charles Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, drew out the implications of the
alleged biblical discrepancies:
The Bible must be the invention either of good men or angels, bad men or devils, or of
God. Therefore:
1. It could not be the invention of good men or angels, for they neither would nor could
make a book, and tell lies all the time they were writing it, saying, "Thus saith the Lord,"
when it was their own invention.
2. It could not be the invention of bad men or devils, for they would not make a book
which commands all duty, forbids all sin, and condemns their souls to hell to all eternity.
3. Therefore, I draw this conclusion, that the Bible must be given by divine inspiration.28
But if the alleged discrepancies are valid, Bible-believing Christians will have to address
their implications for Scripture's inspiration, trustworthiness, and authority.
The Question of Divine Accommodation. Does God accommodate Himself to popular
opinion, even opinions that are in error? Does God in Scripture ever make an incidental
affirmation of a "fact" that was untrue? Some scholars think so. They argue that even though
God or Jesus was aware of the truth of certain minor historical, scientific, or geographical
facts, (a) for the sake of the people at that time whose knowledge of those truths was limited,
and (b) for the sake of effectively communicating His ethical and theological teachings to
them, He deliberately accommodated His message to the needs of the people, sometimes by
adopting mistaken views prevalent in those days.
This view is not only contrary to Scripture's own testimony, it raises many theological
questions:
1. If this view of divine accommodation is right, that is to say, if God intentionally
affirmed incidental falsehoods in order to present greater truths, then God is guilty of telling
"white lies." But the Bible teaches that it is "impossible for God to lie" (Heb 6:18); God
"cannot lie" (Titus 1:2); "thy word is truth" (John 17:17; cf. 10:35).
2. If such a view of accommodation is correct, it raises moral problems for Christians since
they are called to imitate the character of God (Lev 11:44; Eph 5:1).
3. If this position on accommodation is right, it denies the Bible writers' unanimous
affirmation of the truthfulness of every statement in Scripture--not some, or most (Ps 12:6;
18:30; 119:96; Prov 30:5; Matt 22:44-45; Luke 24:25; John 10:35; Acts 3:18; 24:14; Rom
15:4; 2 Tim 3:16-17; etc.).
4. If such a view of divine accommodation is valid, it is contrary to Jesus' claim that "He
who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from Him" (John 8:26, 38).
5. Finally, adopting this view of divine accommodation is contrary to the practice of Jesus,
who refused to accommodate Himself to the mistaken views current in his day. His
statements, "You have heard that it was said of old. . . . But I say unto you" (Matt 5; cf. John
8:24, 44), illustrate this fact. For this reason, Jesus took contrary positions on divorce,
oath-taking, and traditions regarding food (Matt 19:9; 23:16-22; 15:11-20). If Jesus, the
Incarnate Word, deliberately accommodated Himself to mistaken views of His day, He was a
liar and therefore a sinner. But the Bible says that He "did no sin, neither was guile found in
his mouth" (1 Pet 2:22).
The Problem of "Mistakes" or "Errors." By errors, we are not referring to those that
184
may have crept into the text as a result of transmission (e.g. occasional or apparent
discrepancies due to copyist glosses, slips, misspellings, additions, etc.) and which can be
corrected by comparing the various manuscripts.
The question at hand has to do with "errors" alleged to have originated with the Bible
writers themselves at the time they wrote their accounts. For example, was Moses mistaken
when he wrote of a literal six-day creation, a literal Adam and Eve, a literal universal flood, a
miraculous Exodus consisting of over 600,000 males, etc.? Was Matthew deceived or
mistaken about the virgin birth or about the crucifixion and the bodily resurrection of Jesus?
Was Paul misguided when he condemned homosexuality because he lacked knowledge of an
alleged genetic basis for homosexuality? These are the kinds of "errors" we have in mind.
Are the details (however minor) in the Bible accurate and trustworthy, or are they mere
theological statements, void of any factual certainty? How do we define what constitutes an
"error" in Scripture? Does an interpreter possess superior wisdom and spiritual insight to
determine the "mistakes," "contradictions," or "errors" of the Bible? What if the person's
judgment is wrong? What if that individual condemns as "mistaken" what is correct and
endorses as correct what is erroneous?
Bible-believing Christians accept the biblical command: "Trust in the Lord with all thine
heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he
shall direct thy paths" (Prov 3:5, 6).
Therefor, when Bible-believers perceive difficulties in Scripture, rather than judging the
Bible to be "contradictory," they question their own assumptions. As they study prayerfully,
they ask God to shed more light on the difficult passages. God has done so in the past.
For example, through the painstaking studies of the Adventist scholar Edwin Thiele, the
world came to recognize that there are no contradictions in the chronology of the Hebrew
Kings; through the discovery of scientists, He proved that rabbits (Lev 11) chew the cud;
through archaeologists He showed the trustworthiness of historical details of the Old
Testament.29
The decision to suspend judgment as they wrestle with difficult biblical texts is one of the
reasons why Bible-believing scholars study the Bible so earnestly. It would be easier for them
simply to declare unresolved difficulties as errors, thereby avoiding the challenge of seeking
biblical solutions.
Saving Acts vs. Factual Statements. As we pointed out in Chapter Five, Part III, some
scholars suggest that we can accept the Exodus miracle but that the exact number of people
involved in the Exodus is not that crucial; they claim that there was a miraculous flood in
Noah's day but that it was less than a universal event. In effect, these scholars suggest that in
Scripture some things are "essential" and others are "debatable." Their model for biblical
inspiration allows for human imperfections in the "lesser matters" of Scriptures.30
Can we make a distinction between theological statements of God's saving acts and their
accompanying historical descriptions? Is there a dichotomy between true doctrine and true
science? For example, can we separate the theology of creation (the "who" of creation) from
the scientific issues (the "how" and the "how long" of creation)? Can we separate the miracles
of the exodus from the actual number of people who left Egypt and the biblical dating of that
event? On what basis do we accept one and not the other?
Bible writers make no such distinction between saving acts and the historicity of the
details. Some 400-500 years after the events of Moses' day, later Old Testament writers
reaffirmed their historicity (see, for example, Ps 105; 106; Isa 28:21; 1 Kings 16:34).
The New Testament writers, more than a thousand years after the events, trusted even the
smallest details of the Old Testament narratives. They wrote about detailed aspects in the Old
185
Testament accounts of Abraham, Rebecca, and the history of Israel (Acts 13:17-23; Rom
4:10, 19; 9:10-12; 1 Cor 10:1-11). They gave a detailed description of the Old Testament
sanctuary (Heb 9:1-5, 19-21), the manner of creation (Heb 11:3), the particulars of the lives of
Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Rahab and others (Heb 11; 7:2; James 2:25), Esau (Heb
12:16-17), the saving of eight persons during the universal flood (1 Pet 3:20; 2 Pet 2:5; 3:5,
6), and the talking of Balaam's donkey (2 Pet 2:16), etc.
Moreover, Jesus, our example, accepted the full trustworthiness of the Old Testament
accounts, making no distinction between history and theology. For example, He believed in
the historicity of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's universal flood, and Jonah's story
(Matt 19:4, 5; 23:35; 24:38, 39; 12:40).
On the basis of the Scriptures, Bible-believing scholars make no dichotomy between
so-called "essential" and "debatable" aspects of Old Testament saving acts. They do not claim
to be more Christlike than Christ, or more apostolic than the apostles, in their use of
Scripture. Like their Savior, they accept every historical detail--chronology, numbers, events
and people--as a matter of faith and practice.31
Diminishing Scholarly Distortions
We have mentioned that moderate liberals' distortions of the Word arise from their viewing
evaluation as part of interpretation of the biblical text. By imposing their ideological
assumptions on the Bible, such scholars reject as unreliable, mistaken, or erroneous the parts
of Scripture which do not conform to their presuppositions.
In a later chapter, Receiving the Word will address some of the problem passages which
historical-critical scholars often cite as untrustworthy. Here, however, we shall state some key
principles for Bible-believing Adventists to remember whenever they are confronted with
apparent errors, contradictions, or mistakes in the Bible.
The following principles are based on the fact that the Bible is both human and divine.
This mysterious union finds a fitting analogy in the Person of Jesus Christ at his incarnation.
Just as Christ was fully divine even in His humanity, so Scripture is of divine origin though
written by human hands.32 This truth should caution us against hastily ascribing mistakes or
contradictions to the Bible writers.
1. A Divine Document. As a divine document the Bible shares in the unquestionable,
supreme, and infallible authority of God. In the words of Ellen G. White, Christ "pointed to
the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority, and we should do the same. The Bible is to be
presented as the word of the infinite God, as the end of all controversy and the foundation of
all faith."33 "God and heaven alone are infallible. . . . Man is fallible, but God's Word is
infallible."34 Therefore the Bible is "an unerring counselor, and infallible guide" and the
"perfect guide under all circumstances of life";35 "an unerring guide," "the one unerring
guide," "the unerring standard," "an unerring light," "that unerring test," and "the unerring
counsel of God."36
Because the Bible shares in the unerring character of God, we should not question the truth
of any of its parts or pick flaws with what may seem to be mistakes, inconsistencies, or errors.
Neither should we criticize nor ridicule the Scriptures.37 "We should reverence God's word.
For the printed volume we should show respect, never putting it to common uses, or handling
it carelessly."38
2. A Human Document. As a human document the Bible reflects the individuality of its
human writers. "God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world by human
186
agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit, qualified men and enabled them to do this
work. He guided the mind in the selection of what to speak and what to write (The Great
Controversy, p. vi).
"In our Bible, we might ask, Why need Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the Gospels,
why need the Acts of the Apostles, and the variety of writers in the Epistles, go over the same
thing? The Lord gave His word in just the way He wanted it to come. He gave it through
different writers, each having his own individuality, though going over the same history.
Their testimonies are brought together in one Book, and are like the testimonies in a social
meeting [testimony service]. They do not represent things in just the same style. Each has an
experience of his own, and this diversity broadens and deepens the knowledge that is brought
out to meet the necessities of varied minds. The thoughts expressed have not a set uniformity,
as if cast in an iron mold, making the very hearing monotonous. In such uniformity there
would be a loss of grace" (Selected Messages, 1:21-22).
Rather than looking for alleged contradictions in the parallel accounts (e.g., the different
ways the Gospel writers presented their accounts), we must look for underlying harmony.
"The Creator of all ideas may impress different minds with the same thought, but each may
express it in a different way, yet without contradiction. The fact that this difference exists
should not perplex or confuse us. It is seldom that two persons will view and express truth in
the very same way. Each dwells on particular points which his constitution and education
have fitted him to appreciate. The sunlight falling upon the different objects gives those
objects a different hue" (Selected Messages, 1:22, emphasis supplied).
3. A Trustworthy Document. In a trustworthy document, unresolved difficulties should
challenge interpreters' assumptions, attitudes, and approaches. Since the Bible is reliable and
trustworthy, and since there is an underlying harmony in all of its parts, whenever there
appears to be a contradiction or mistake in the Scriptures, Bible-believing students should
seriously examine their own presuppositions, attitudes, and approach to Scripture.
Conclusion
This chapter has briefly discussed why and how the authority of the Bible is often
diminished from the liberating Word (at the hands of the inspired writers), through the
process of liberating the Word (by copyists and translators who seek to make the Bible
accessible to average people), to the liberated Word (at the hands of interpreters). While there
was no distortion of the Word when the Bible writers communicated their inspired messages,
and while minor distortions of the Word developed during the time of transmission (i.e.,
copying and translation), the grossest distortions of the Word occur at the hand of interpreters.
This raises the question: How can Christians today, who have received the Word as
inspired, trustworthy, and their sole authoritative norm, ensure that the Bible in their hands
will truly function as the liberating Word of God? The answer lies in rightly dividing the
Word. To this issue we turn our attention in the next chapter.

chapter 11 we will briefly discuss the methodologies of liberation and feminist theologies.
3. Kathleen McCan called my attention to a slight distinction between an "alteration" and
a "distortion." An alteration occurs when there is a change in an original document.
Sometimes the alteration (or changing) of a single word of a sender's message does not
change the essential meaning (e.g., "Thus saith the Lord" and "Thus speaketh the Lord"
convey the same exact meaning). Other times an alteration effects a slightly different meaning
than that which was originally intended (e.g., the insertion of a comma by translators of Luke
23:43 has Jesus as saying, "Verily I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me in paradise").
While the essential message of Jesus, His assurance to the thief on the cross, is preserved, the
timing of when the thief would be with Jesus introduces a (slightly) different meaning to the
words of Jesus. Still, some alterations involve a deliberate distortion (e.g., the translation of
John 1:1 in the Jehovah's Witnesses' New World Translation inserts the single letter word "a"
before God: "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was a
god"). In short, while there were no distortions from the original Bible writers, some
alterations and minor distortions have been introduced in the Word during the copyig and
translation process.
4. Ernst Würthwein, an authority in textual criticism, offered some reasons for
transmission errors: "We know how easily errors can occur in copying a text. By accident a
word may be missed or repeated, groups of words may be inadvertently transposed or
replaced by similar or synonymous words, and if the handwriting is difficult to read, an
element of guesswork may enter. Many errors may be due to carelessness, especially if the
copyist is a professional scribe who works rapidly and becomes casual, and further may not
be familiar with the subject of the text he is copying. But even the scribe who approaches his
text with interest and devotion may introduce corruptions. He may find an expression in his
exemplar which in his view reflects an earlier scribe's misunderstanding of the author, and in
his concern for the meaning of the text he naturally corrects it, just as we would correct a
typographical error in a printed book. But his correction itself could very well reflect his own
misunderstanding! It is not only the casual or absentminded scribe who introduces errors, but
the conscientious scribe as well. The next stage in the process is obvious. A scribe copying a
faulty manuscript--and no manuscript is without errors--will deal with his predecessor's errors
either by guesswork or with ingenuity, with the result a series of intended improvements
leading away from the original text" (see Ernst Würthwein, The Text of the Old Testament,
trans. Errol F. Rhodes [Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1979], p. xvii).

5,000 Greek New Testament manuscripts with other ancient historical material, Bruce, the
classicist turned biblical scholar, wrote: "Perhaps we can appreciate how wealthy the New
Testament is in manuscript attestation if we compare the textual material for other ancient
historical works. For Caesar's Gallic War (composed between 58 and 50 B.C.) there are
several extant MSS [manuscripts], but only nine or ten are good, and the oldest is some 900
years later than Caesar's day. Of the 142 books of the Roman History of Livy (59 B.C.-A.D.
17) only thirty-five survive; these are known to us from not more than twenty MSS of any
consequence, only one of which, and that containing fragments of Books iii-vi, is as old as the
fourth century. Of the fourteen books of the Histories of Tacitus (c. A.D. 100) only four and a
half survive; of the sixteen books of his Annals, ten survive in full and two in part. The text of
these extant portions of his two great historical works depends entirely on two MSS, one of
the ninth century and one of the eleventh. The extant MSS of his minor works (Dialogus de
Oratoribus, Agricola, Germania) all descend from a codex of the tenth century. The History
of Thucydides (c. 460-400 B.C.) is known to us from eight MSS, the earliest belonging to c.
A.D. 900, and a few papyrus scraps, belonging to about the beginning of the Christian era. The
same is true of the History of Herodotus (c. 488-428 B.C.). Yet no classical scolar would listen
to an argument that the authenticity of Herodotus or Thucydides is in doubt because the
earliest MSS of their works which are of any use to us are over 1,300 years later than the
originals" (ibid., pp. 16-17).

11. Since some manuscripts omit or place in brackets the texts of John 7:53-8:11 and
Mark 16:9-20, textual scholars, whether liberal or conservative, disagree over whether or not
these are part of the apostolic autographs. Their disagreements relate to the rules they apply in
their work of textual analysis. This much, though, can be said: "It is true that the longer
ending of Mark 16:9-20 is found in 99 percent of the Greek manuscripts as well as the rest of
the tradition, enjoying over a period of centuries practically an official sanction as a genuine
part of the gospel of Mark. But in Codex Vaticanus (B) as well as in Codex Sinaiticus ( ) ) the
gospel of Mark ends at Mark 16:8, as it did also in numerous other manuscripts according to
the statements of Eusebius of Caesarea and Jerome" (Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland, The Text
of the New Testament, trans. Erroll F. Rhodes [Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1987], p.

Rightly Dividing the Word
One major reason for today's gross distortion of the Word is that students, teachers,
preachers, and leaders handle the Scriptures in a careless manner.
Lamenting this lackadaisical recklessness toward Scripture, one non-Adventist author
wrote: "Imagine the practical implications if teachers of mathematics or chemistry were as
slapdash as some who handle the Word of God. Would you want to be served by a
pharmacist, for example, who used the 'best guess' method of filling prescriptions? Or would
you take your business to an architect who worked mostly with approximations? Or would
you allow a surgeon to operate on you with a table knife instead of a scalpel? The sad truth is
that society would quickly grind to a halt if most professions approached their work the way
many Bible teachers do."1
Against this background of recklessness toward the Word, the charge of the apostle Paul to
Timothy becomes particularly relevant. "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a
workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth" (2 Tim 2:15).
Rightly dividing the Word demands that in interpreting the Scriptures, the Bible student must:
(1) not depart from the Word; (2) not doubt the Word; (3) adopt the right presuppositions and
attitudes toward the Word; and (4) uphold the plain reading of Scripture.
These four requirements arise from Scripture itself, which is why they are found in the
1986 "Methods of Bible Study" document (see Appendix C). In this chapter of Receiving the
Word, we shall flesh out these guidelines by citing some relevant passages from the writings
of Ellen G. White.
Do Not Depart from the Word
In order to divide the Word rightly, the Bible student must first accept the Word
wholeheartedly as the inspired, trustworthy, and solely authoritative norm for the Christian.
Regrettably, many in our day are reluctant to do so. But Bible-believing Seventh-day
Adventists have not been left in the dark about how Satan is working to lead people away
from the truth. Deceiving Bible students, teachers, preachers, and scholars is part of Satan's
end-time strategy to cut people away from their only source of authoritative knowledge.
"In these days of delusion, every one who is established in the truth will have to contend
for the faith once delivered to the saints. Every variety of error will be brought out in the
mysterious working of Satan, which would, if it were possible, deceive the very elect, and
turn them from the truth" (Selected Messages, 2:98).
Ellen White proceeded to identify four major kinds of deception that Satan will introduce
in order to lead Christians away from their trust and reliance in the Bible: deception from
learned persons, deception through ignorance and folly, deception from false dreams and
visions, and deception subtly disguised as truth (see Selected Messages, 2:98-100).2
In view of these deceptions, Christians must always insist upon the Bible as more
authoritative than the opinions of human beings, whether educated or not, and regardless of
whether these human opinions are attended by supernatural phenomena or disguised in
angelic garments.
Rightly dividing the Word demands an uncompromising insistence upon the Word as the
one non-negotiable basis of all theological discussions. Not even the decisions of church
committees, the majority vote of church members, or results from public opinion polls should
192
be exalted above the plain teaching of Scripture.
We are told: "God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the Bible
only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms. The opinions of learned
men, the deductions of science, the creeds or decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous
and discordant as are the churches which they represent, the voice of the majority--not one
nor all of these should be regarded as evidence for or against any point of religious faith.
Before accepting any doctrine or precept, we should demand a plain 'Thus saith the Lord' in
its support" (The Great Controversy, p. 595, emphasis supplied).
Do Not Doubt the Word
The second step in rightly dividing the Word is not to doubt the Word. There are two major
reasons why Christians must not doubt the Word.
First, the Bible is the most authoritative guide for Christian doctrine and conduct. "All
Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good works" (2 Tim 3:16, 17).
Receiving the Word has a profound impact on the Bible student. Ellen White explains: "No
other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad,
ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a
breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times"
(Steps to Christ, p. 90).
Second, God desires to help every Bible student rightly to understand and apply its truths.
Through the ministry of the Holy Spirit and the guidance of heavenly angels, those who study
the Bible are to be led "to feel the importance of those things easy to be understood" and they
are to be prevented "from wresting truths difficult of comprehension." God's ultimate desire is
that interpreters of His written Word will "be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its
warnings, or animated and strengthened by its promises" (The Great Controversy, pp. 599,
600).
In view of the importance of the Word in the Christian's life and the willingness of God to
help believers understand its message, Bible students must always trust the Word. When there
seems to be cause to doubt the Word, Christians must be mindful of the various factors that
can contribute to their doubts:
1. Some Doubts about the Bible are Due to Wrong Assumptions. "All do not
understand expressions and statements alike. Some understand the statements of the
Scriptures to suit their own particular minds and cases. Prepossessions, prejudices, and
passions have a strong influence to darken the understanding" (Selected Messages, 1:20).
"The Lord designs that our opinions shall be put to the test, that we may see the necessity of
closely examining the living oracles to see whether or not we are in the faith" (Review and
Herald, December 20, 1892).
"You are not to take your ideas to the Bible, and make your opinions a center around
which truth is to revolve. You are to lay aside your ideas at the door of investigation, and with
humble, subdued hearts, with self hid in Christ, with earnest prayer, you are to seek wisdom
for God" (Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 308).
"There are men who strive to be original, who are wise above what is written; therefore,
their wisdom is foolishness. They discover wonderful things in advance, ideas which reveal
that they are far behind in the comprehension of the divine will and purposes of God. In
seeking to make plain or to unravel mysteries hid from ages from mortal man, they are like a
193
man floundering about in the mud, unable to extricate himself and yet telling others how to
get out of the muddy sea they themselves are in. This is a fit representation of the men who
set themselves to correct the errors of the Bible. No man can improve the Bible by suggesting
what the Lord meant to say or ought to have said" (Selected Messages, 1:16).
2. Some Doubts about the Bible are Due to Human Pride and Arrogance. "Those who
think to make the supposed difficulties of Scripture plain, in measuring by their finite rule that
which is inspired and that which is not inspired, had better cover their faces, as Elijah when
the still small voice spoke to him; for they are in the presence of God and holy angels, who
for ages have communicated to men light and knowledge, telling them what to do and what
not to do, unfolding before them scenes of thrilling interest, waymark by waymark in symbols
and signs and illustrations" (Selected Messages, 1:17).
"The ingenuity of men has been exercised for ages to measure the Word of God by their
finite minds and limited comprehension. If the Lord, the Author of the living oracles, would
throw back the curtain and reveal His wisdom and His glory before them, they would shrink
into nothingness and exclaim as did Isaiah, 'I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the
midst of a people of unclean lips' (Isa. 6:5)." (Selected Messages, 1:18; cf. Seventh-day
Adventist Bible Commentary, 7:919-920).
"It is sometimes the case that men of intellectual ability, improved by education and
culture, fail to comprehend certain passages of Scripture, while others who are uneducated,
whose understanding seems weak and whose minds are undisciplined, will grasp the meaning,
finding strength and comfort in that which the former declare to be mysterious or pass by as
unimportant. Why is this? It has been explained to me that the latter class do not rely upon
their own understanding. They go to the Source of light, the One who has inspired the
Scriptures, and with humility of heart ask God for wisdom, and they receive it. There are
mines of truth yet to be discovered by the earnest seeker" (Testimonies for the Church,
5:704).
"Christ represented the truth as treasure hid in a field. It does not lie right upon the surface;
we must dig for it. But our success in finding it does not depend so much on our intellectual
ability as on our humility of heart and the faith which will lay hold upon divine aid" (ibid.).
3. Some Doubts about the Bible are Due to Superficial Reading. "As several [Bible]
writers present a subject under varied aspects and relations, there may appear, to the
superficial, careless, or prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or contradiction, where the
thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer insight, discerns the underlying harmony" (The
Great Controversy, p. vi).
"The truths of the Bible are as pearls hidden. They must be searched, dug out by
painstaking effort. Those who take only a surface view of the Scriptures will, with their
superficial knowledge, which they think is very deep, talk of the contradictions of the Bible,
and questio the authority of the Scriptures. But those whose hearts are in harmony with truth
and duty will search the Scriptures with a heart prepared to receive divine impressions. The
illuminated soul sees a spiritual unity, one grand golden thread running through the whole,
but it requires patience, thought, and prayer to trace out the precious golden thread" (Selected
Messages, 1:20).
"Without the guidance of the Holy Spirit we shall be continually liable to wrest the
Scriptures or to misinterpret them. There is much reading of the Bible that is without profit
and in many cases is a positive injury. When the Word of God is opened without reverence
and without prayer; when the thoughts and affections are not fixed upon God or in harmony
with His will, the mind is clouded with doubt; and in the very study of the Bible, skepticism
194
strengthens. The enemy takes control of the thoughts, and he suggests interpretations that are
not correct" (Testimonies for the Church, 5:704, 705).
4. Some Doubts about the Bible are Instigated by Satan. "Men arise who think they find
something to criticize in God's Word. They lay it bare before others as evidence of superior
wisdom. These men are, many of them, smart men, learned men, they have eloquence and
talent, the whole lifework [of whom] is to unsettle minds in regard to the inspiration of the
Scriptures. They influence many to see as they do. And the same work is passed on from one
to another, just as Satan designed it should be" (Selected Messages, 1:17).
"Man can be exalted only by laying hold of the merits of a crucified and risen Savior. The
finest intellect, the most exalted position, will not secure heaven. Satan had the highest
education that could be obtained. This education he received under the greatest of all teachers.
When men talk of higher criticism, when they pass their judgment upon the word of God, call
their attention to the fact that they have forgotten who was the first and wisest critic. He has
had thousands of years of practical experience. He it is who teaches the so-called higher
critics of the world today. God will punish all those who, as higher critics, exalt themselves,
and criticize God's Holy word" (Review and Herald, March 16, 1897).
Adopt the Right Presuppositions and Attitudes toward the Word
To rightly divide the Word, Seventh-day Adventist students of the Bible must adopt the
right presuppositions and attitudes consistent with the nature of the Bible as God's holy,
inspired and trustworthy Word. The following are some key assumptions and attitudes that
can aid the interpreter:
1. The Bible. The Bible is God's inspired Word. The Holy Spirit inspired the human
writers with thoughts, ideas, and objective information and guided them in communicating
the message. Thus, in the written Word, just as in the Incarnate Word, Jesus Christ, there
exists an indivisible union of human and divine elements, neither of which should be
emphasized to the neglect of the other (2 Pet 1:21; cf. The Great Controversy, pp. v, vi).
Although written in an ancient Near Eastern/Mediterranean setting, the Bible transcends its
cultural backgrounds. Since human nature is essentially the same, and since God's
expectations of human beings do not change, irrespective of their culture and time, the Bible
speaks to all cultural, racial, and situational contexts of all ages. The message of Scripture, the
written Word, is therefore no more culturally conditioned than is the message of Jesus Christ,
the Incarnate Word, who lived in the same culture and proclaimed God's eternal message to
the entire human race.
Because the Bible is not culturally conditioned, the accounts in Scripture--including the
Bible's history, science, miracles, chronologies, prophecies, etc.--must be trusted as authentic
and reliable.
2. The Human Interpreter. Since human beings are finite and sinful, they cannot on their
own arrive at a saving knowledge of truth without the Holy Spirit's guidance. Thus, while
human reason is to be employed to the fullest, confidence in one's natural mental powers
actually blocks spiritual understanding. Reason must never be king; it must always be the
servant within the context and under the authority of God's Word.
As a sinner, every interpreter comes to Scripture with certain individual, cultural, and
religious biases or prejudices (what scholars refer to as "preunderstandings"). These
preconceived ideas or blind spots tend to obstruct the correct understanding of the Word. The
195
way to surmount them is through the Spirit's twofold work of regeneration and sanctification,
during which the mental powers of the believer are redirected and renewed day by day to
conform to the true biblical worldview. Interpreters receive this divine help by approaching
Scripture in humble dependence upon the Holy Spirit.
3. The Holy Spirit's Guidance. The attitude of submission does not mean that the
interpreter must abdicate the powers of reason or private judgment. Instead, submission
ensures that these powers will be sanctified through the Spirit's work of illumination (John
14:26; 16:13, 14; 1 Cor 2:10-14; 1 John 2:27).
One way by which an interpreter expresses humility and submissiveness before God is by
prayer. Bible students must pray before and after reading the written Word. Through prayer
they are connected with the mind of the Holy Spirit, the real Author of inspired Scripture.
To benefit fully from the Spirit's illumination, the interpreter must be willing to submit to
the teachings of Scripture. Psalm 119:34 is a model prayer that illustrates the correct attitude
for approaching the Scriptures: "Give me understanding, that I may keep thy law and observe
it with my whole heart." Christians must not only distrust themselves and their thoughts, they
must also be willing to obey whatever the Bible teaches them.
"Many a portion of Scripture which learned men pronounce a mystery, or pass over as
unimportant, is full of comfort and instruction to him who has been taught in the school of
Christ. One reason why many theologians have no clearer understanding of God's Word is,
they close their eyes to truths which they do not wish to practice. An understanding of Bible
truth depends not so much on the power of intellect brought to the search as on the singleness
of purpose, the earnest longing after righteousness" (The Great Controversy, p. 599).
"Whenever men are not seeking, in word and deed, to be in harmony with God, then,
however learned they may be, they are liable to err in their understanding of Scripture, and it
is not safe to trust to their explanations. When we are truly seeking to do God's will, the Holy
Spirit takes the precepts of His word and makes them the principles of the life, writing them
on the tablets of the soul. And it is only those who are following the light already given that
can hope to receive the further illumination of the Spirit" (Testimonies for the Church, 5:705).
4. Other Considerations. Following are some important considerations before one
actually starts to study the Scriptures.
(a) Select an appropriate Bible version. Where one cannot read the original languages in
which the Bible was given, one must choose a Bible translation. Select a Bible version that is
faithful to the meaning contained in Hebrew or Greek, giving preference to translations done
by a broad group of scholars rather than by an individual, a small group, or a particular
denomination.
Also, remember that there are two major approaches adopted by Bible translators. On one
side are literal, "formal-equivalent" versions which attempt to offer word-for-word,
clause-for-clause, sentence-for-sentence translation of the original language. The King James
Version and the New American Standard Bible (ASB) are examples of this approach. As far
as possible, this approach preserves the original wording of the Bible, even though it may
sometimes be difficult to understand or awkward to read.
On the other side are paraphrases and "dynamic equivalent" versions, such as the Living
Bible and the Clear Word, which employ contemporary expressions to present the same kind
of impact the Bible had on its original hearers. While this approach makes the Bible "come
alive," it often loses many of the nuances of the original language, and it is much more likely
to reflect the translator's biases. In using paraphrases, Bible students must be aware of their
dangers. The preface of the Living Bible contains this important statement:
196
"There are dangers in paraphrases, as well as values. For whenever the author's exact
words are not translated from the original languages, there is a possibility that the translator,
however honest, may be giving the English reader something that the original writer did not
mean to say. This is because a paraphrase is guided not only by the translator's skill in
simplifying but also by the clarity of his understanding of what the author meant and by his
theology. For when the Greek or Hebrew is not clear, then the theology of the translator is his
guide, along with his sense of logic, unless perchance the translation is allowed to stand
without any clear meaning at all. The theological lodestar in this book has been a rigid
evangelical position."
The author of The Clear Word Bible made the same point in his preface: "This is not a new
translation but a paraphrase of the Scriptures. It is not intended for in-depth study or for
public reading in churches. Those who are better qualified have given readers of the Holy
Scriptures excellent translations for such purposes and undoubtedly will continue to do so as
additional manuscripts come to light."3
Thus, the two approaches to Bible translations--word-for-word and paraphrases--have their
strengths and weaknesses. Between the two extremes are versions which seek to enjoy the
best of both worlds, such as the Revised Standard Version, which lies closer to the
word-for-word approach, and the New International Version, leaning toward the dynamic
equivalence side.
With so many Bible versions in English, it is important to choose carefully the version in
which to study the Bible. Two helpful guides to selecting English Bibles are the books So
Many Versions and The English Bible from KJV to NIV.4
Serious Bible students may want to adopt a suggestion that some have found useful: Use at
least four Bible versions: (1) the King James Version, with its majestic language and hallowed
associations; (2) a word-for-word version (e.g. the New American Standard Bible); (3) a
paraphrase (e.g., The Clear Word Bible or The Living Bible); and (4) one from the middle
(e.g., the Revised Standard Version or the New International Version). While concentrating
on one version for reading and memorizing, it is best to compare the various versions
regularly. The best Bible version, however, is still the original Hebrew and Greek.
(b) Choose a plan of Bible study. To avoid the dangers of illegitimate proof-texting (see
Chapter One of this book), the interpreter must settle on a definite plan. One can adopt, for
example, a book-by-book study, a topical study (e.g., salvation, second coming, the Sabbath,
hope, etc.), a biographical study (such as the life of Joseph, Hannah, Elijah, Daniel, Peter,
John, Mary, etc.), or a word study (e.g. peace, love, sin, etc.). Following a definite plan in
studying the Scriptures can help avoid the haphazard and aimless approaches of the proof-text
method.
A plan of Bible study should include how to study Scriptures for maximum benefit. "There
is but little benefit derived from a hasty reading of the Scriptures. One may read the whole
Bible through, and yet fail to see its beauty or to comprehend its deep and hidden meaning.
One passage studied until its significance is clear to the mind, and its relation to the plan of
salvation is evident, is of more value than the peusal of many chapters with no definite
purpose in view and no positive instruction gained. Keep your Bible with you. As you have
opportunity, read it; fix the texts in your memory. Even while you are walking the streets, you
may read a passage, and meditate upon it, thus fixing it in the mind" (Steps to Christ, p. 90).
(c) Make a commitment to "sola scriptura." Upholding sola scriptura (the sole authority
of Scripture) means believing and obeying all that Scripture sets forth, letting Scripture judge
and control every thought and practice--including biblical interpretation. Against Scripture,
there is no appeal, for "the scripture cannot be broken" (John 10:35).
In upholding the sole authority of Scripture, we acknowledge that it is both sufficient (i.e.,
197
it contains all that the church needs to know for guidance in the way of salvation and for the
work of ministry) and clear (i.e., it can be understood from within itself, by comparing one
passage of Scripture with another) (2 Tim 3:16-17). This means that Scripture does not need
to be supplemented by an external source (human reason, experience, tradition). Neither is it
to be interpreted in the light of some outside source (e.g., ecclesiastical tradition, philosophy,
science, extrabiblical religion, psychology, etc.), as though the authority of such a source
were equal to or above that of Scripture. Rather, the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture affirm
the Protestant Reformation principle that Scripture must remain its own interpreter.
Both the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture imply that the Spirit, as the infallible
interpreter, can enable every sincere seeker of truth to know God's will (John 7:17). This does
not mean that no difficulties will be found in the Bible, but only that because the Holy Spirit
attends the Word, every Christian--scholar and non-scholar--can understand the substance of
the Bible's message by comparing Scripture with Scripture.
Uphold Adventism's Plain Reading of Scripture
Against the methods of higher criticism, Seventh-day Adventists have traditionally
followed the sixteenth century Protestant Reformers in seeking the plain meaning of
Scripture. This approach seeks to discover the historical, grammatical, literary meaning of
Scripture, and on the basis of what the text meant to its original recipients, the interpreter
makes a responsible application to contemporary needs. As we showed in Chapter One, this
approach to the plain meaning of Scripture is not a proof-text method, contrary to what
proponents of the historical-critical method want people to believe.5
The traditional Adventist approach to Scripture is opposed to the modern liberal
approaches known collectively as the historical-critical method. The difference between these
two conflicting approaches does not lie merely in the names, but rather in their underlying
assumptions. For this reason, merely changing the name from "historical-critical method" to
"historical method," "principle approach," "contextual approach," "casebook approach,"
"matured approach," "progressive approach," "Christ-centered," "developmental," or some
other term cannot make the method acceptable.
Inasmuch as the Rio de Janeiro document ("Methods of Bible Study") that was approved at
the 1986 Annual Council in Brazil is in harmony with the plain teachings of Scripture, we
recommend its guidelines to Bible-believing Adventists who seek to do serious and faithful
study of the Bible (see Appendix C). The following ten principles are implied in the Adventist
approach. Think of them as Adventism's Hermeneutical Decalogue:6
1. The Literal Principle. Interpreting the Scriptures literally means we must understand
the Bible in its plain, obvious, and normal sense. We must not allegorize or spiritualize it
away in order to find some hidden, mystical, deeper, or secret meaning. The literal or plain
meaning of Scripture should not be confused with a "literalistic" interpretation, which fails to
recognize figures of speech like parables, symbols, similes, and hyperboles in the Bible.
The literal principle recognizes different kinds of literature in the Bible, each known
technically as a genre. Genres are of two kinds. First, some genres describe compositions of a
Bible book: gospel (e.g., Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), epistle (e.g., the letters to the
Corinthians and Galatians), narrative (e.g., Genesis), prophecy/preaching (e.g. Isaiah),
wisdom (e.g., Proverbs and Ecclesiastes), apocalyptic (e.g., Daniel, Revelation), etc.
Embedded within each genre composition is a second kind of genre. This includes: history,
parable, poetry, metaphors, symbols, or allegory.
The genre of a text affects how it is interpreted. The interpretation of a poetic text (e.g. the
198
Psalms) would be different from that of a narrative (e.g. Acts). Interpreting a wisdom book
such as Proverbs may not require a historical context to understand the universal application
as would a book like Philemon. Similarly, if a text is a parable, the details--people, events,
times, and places--may not be historical. But even though parables may be hypothetical,
metaphorical, or simply stories drawn from everyday occurrences, spiritual truths that are
illustrated by the parables always do have literal meaning. The same can be said of symbolic
language in Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Revelation. Though symbols and figures are
used, by careful study one can ascertain the literal truth they communicate. The literal
principle therefore suggests that one must look for the plain, obvious, clear, normal meaning
of Scripture, even in the figures of speech that are employed.
Thus, we must clearly understand the use of simile (e.g., "He [a righteous man] is like a
tree planted by the rivers of water" [Ps 1:3]; the Lord's anointed Messenger "shall sit as a
refiner and purifier of silver" [Mal 3:3]); metaphor (e.g., Jesus said of Herod, "Go ye, and tell
that fox . . ." [Luke 13:32]); hyperbole (e.g., "I am weary with my groaning; all the night
make I my bed to swim [in tears]; I water my couch with my tears" [Ps 6:6]); figures of
speech or idiomatic expressions (e.g., "the mountains and the hills shall break forth before
you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands" [Isa 55:12]); paradox
(e.g., "the last shall be the first, and the first last" [Matt 20:16]); allegory (e.g., Paul's
allegorical use of the story of Sarah and Hagar [Gal 4:22-31]); typology (e.g., the earthly
sanctuary, priesthood, kingship, and the experience of Old Testament Israel [1 Cor 10:1-13;
Rom 5:12-21; 1 Pet 3:18-22; Ex 25:40; Heb 8 and 9]); etc.7
2. Grammatical Principle. This principle requires an interpreter to pay close attention to
words, wordings, and context of any given text.8 Words like "love," "fear," or "hear"
sometimes translate more than one Hebrew or Greek word and in some cases may have more
than one meaning. This should not be a problem to interpreters. After all, even in the English
language, depending on the context, the word love may express fondness ("I love ice cream"),
preference ("I love Toyota cars"), endearment ("I love my child, wife, husband, mother,
etc."), religious devotion ("I love Jesus"), or even sex ("They made love to one another").
The grammatical principle requires the interpreter to understand the meaning of words in
their immediate context as well as in the larger context of the Bible. Failure to do so results in
reading meanings into the Bible--such as when some homosexual theologians suggest that
when the Bible says David loved Jonathan, it refers to a homosexual relationship.
Importance of Words. Words are important for two reasons. First, even though the Bible
writers employed their own words in writing Scripture, they were divinely guided in the
choice of those words (see 2 Sam 23:2-3; 1 Chron 28:19; Jer 26:2; 36:2; Eze 2:2; 11:5; Micah
3:8; John 6:63; 1 Cor 2:13; Rev 22:19; cf. Ex 4:10-16; cf. 7:1-2).
As we noted in Chapter Two, the Spirit's guidance of the inspired writers in expressing
their God-given thoughts and ideas in their own words is known technically as verbal
(propositional) inspiration. We should not confuse this with mechanical (dictation)
inspiration, a mistaken theory which claims that the Holy Spirit dictated each word of
Scripture.
Ellen G. White wrote concerning her experience: "I am just as dependent upon the Spirit in
relating or writing the vision as in having the vision." Again: "Although I am as dependent
upon the Spirit of the Lord in writing my views as I am in receiving them, yet the words I
employ in describing what I have seen are my own, unless they be those spoken to me by an
angel, which I always enclose in marks of quotation" (Selected Messages, 3:48, 49, emphasis
supplied). Thus, words are important.
Second, while we may use words carelessly in our private communications, such as in our
199
private letters or school notes, words are particularly important when authoritative documents
are being written. Since we pay attention to words and wording in making our wills, in
signing business agreements, and in enacting laws in Parliament or Congress, why should we
expect to do any less for the words in the most important document human beings have--the
Bible?
Thus, even whether a word is in the singular or plural, or in the present tense or past tense,
is extremely important. The apostle Paul used a single word in the singular as the basis for his
argument showing that Jesus is the mediator of the covenant (Gal 3:16; cf. John 10:34-36).
On another occasion Jesus argued his Deity on the basis of the present tense (John 8:57-58).
Importance of Wording. Also, the way a text is worded--the arrangement and positions of
words in sentences--may communicate important ideas such as emphasis or connection. For
example, beginning a sentence with "therefore," "because," "nevertheless," or "wherefore"
may suggest a link with the previous sentence. As in English we tend to use italics and
punctuation marks (e.g. the exclamation sign [!]) for emphasis, we need to watch for other
signs of emphasis in the Bible writings.
To illustrate the importance of wording and punctuation, consider the difference a little
comma made at a wedding. Just after the pastor had pronounced the couple husband and wife,
a special delivery person rushed in with a telegram from the bride's closest friend, who had
been unable to arrive on time because of a flight delay. From the airport she sought to send a
telegram that read: "PASTOR, AFTER PRONOUNCING MARY AND JOHN HUSBAND AND WIFE, READ
FIRST JOHN 4:18 AS MY SPECIAL MESSAGE TO MARY."
Now 1 John 4:18 reads: "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear." But in
her haste, the bride's girl-friend made a little mistake (just a comma), and instead sent this
telegram: "PASTOR, AFTER PRONOUNCING MARY AND JOHN HUSBAND AND WIFE, READ FIRST,
JOHN 4:18 AS MY SPECIAL MESSAGE TO MARY."
Delighted by this timely message, the pastor opened to John 4:18 and read aloud: "For
thou has had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. . . ."
Are the rules of grammar important? Ask Mary. The point of this story is that we must pay
close attention to such things as the Bible writers' words, wordings, idioms, and the style they
employed in quoting sources in the Old Testament. In the Bible, the position of a word in a
sentence sometimes indicates emphasis. Thus, Bible students, especially those using the
Hebrew and Greek, need to respect how the Bible writers worded their messages. In putting
into practice the grammatical principle of interpretation, Bible students may use helpful tools
like dictionaries in English, Greek, and Hebrew, and Bible concordances, which list every ord
in the Bible and where that word appears.
Importance of context. Interpreters must give careful consideration to a text's immediate
context--the verses before and after a given passage, making up its logical unit or paragraph.
For as we mentioned in Chapter One in discussing the proof-text method, a text taken out of
its context (whether historical, literary or grammatical) is a pretext.
In determining context, one must remember that today's chapter and verse divisions in our
Bibles, while useful in assisting readers to locate particular passages, were not part of the
original. Neither Moses nor Paul, for example, divided their books into chapters and verses.
The chapters in our current Bibles originated with Stephen Langton, who introduced them
into the Latin Bible at the beginning of the thirteenth century. Verse divisions in the Old
Testament come from Rabbi Isaac Nathan around A.D. 1440, and New Testament verse
divisions from Robert Stephanus in A.D. 1551.9 So, one must not necessarily be restricted by
chapter and verse divisions in deciding the context of a text.
3. Historical Principle. Interpreting the Bible historically calls for a grasp of the cultural,
200
political, and religious setting in which a passage was written. It involves an understanding
of the political situation (slavery, exile, persecution, etc.), the religious developments (e.g.,
the spiritual condition of Old Testament Israel in the days of the judges was different from the
condition in the days of King Josiah), and the cultural backgrounds. With the aid of Bible
concordances, one can come to a reasonable understanding of the historical and cultural
background from the Bible itself.
Bible dictionaries, handbooks, and commentaries may be useful, although one must be
extremely careful in selecting these scholarly tools. Many academic resources are based on
speculative reconstructions.
Understanding the historical background enables today's interpreters to put themselves "in
the shoes" of those who received the Bible messages originally. For example, when reading
the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), "Let us in imagination go back to that scene, and, as
we sit with the disciples on the mountainside, enter into the thoughts and feelings that filled
their hearts. Understanding what the words of Jesus meant to those who heard them, we may
discern in them a new vividness and beauty, and may also gather for ourselves their deeper
lessons" (Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 1).
4. Canonical Principle. The canonical principle recognizes that the information we need
to understand the Bible is found in the canon of Scripture itself; thus Scripture is to be its own
interpreter. This is a valid Reformation principle (often known as the "analogy of Scripture")
which Seventh-day Adventists historically have upheld.
The canonical principle rejects the widespread contemporary practice of scholars. Instead
of allowing the entire sixty-six books of the Bible to be the only context for understanding
biblical history and culture, they tend to read the Bible in the light of ancient cultures of Bible
times, and even in the light of some modern cultures. They believe that these extra-biblical
data hold the key to the meaning of Scripture.
For example, such scholars deny that Moses actually got the pattern of his sanctuary from
what God revealed to him (Ex 25:40), saying instead that he borrowed the idea from some
ancient Canaanite culture. Also, though Paul grounds his doctrine of male-female
relationships in creation and in the fall (1 Tim 2:11ff.; 1 Cor 11:3, 9, 11; 14:34-35), some
would rather believe that his arguments were occasioned by the cultural conditions of his day
(e.g., the worship of the goddess Artemis or Diana, Gnostic philosophy, etc.).10 Moreover, in
deciding whether tongues (Greek glossa) in 1 Corinthians 12-14 should be understood as
speaking real languages or some unintelligible ecstatic utterances, some scholars are more
influenced by contemporary religious manifestations (Christian and non-Christian) than by
the testimony of Scripture itself (Acts 2; 10:44-4; 11:15-17; 19:1-7).11 In these examples,
cultural practices--past and present--become the ultimate norm in interpretation, not sola
scriptura.
Whenever we fail to allow Scripture to interpret itself, instead depending on a few elite
scholars to tell us what may have been the actual background of a particular passage, we are
making fallible human speculation, tradition, experience, or custom the norm of authority. In
effect, such scholarly speculations deny that Scripture is sufficient and clear. Ellen White
rejected this approach: "Men need not the dim light of tradition and custom to make the
Scriptures comprehensible. It is just as sensible to suppose that the sun, shining in the heavens
at noon-day, needs the glimmerings of the torchlight of earth to increase its glory. In the Bible
every duty is made plain, every lesson is comprehensible" (Fundamentals of Christian
Education, p. 391).
The Protestant principle that Scripture is its own interpreter discredits the popular belief
that every person or theologian is his own interpreter. If every person is his own interpreter,
201
one can easily misinterpret a lack of consensus among theologians on issues such as women's
ordination, homosexuality, and speaking in tongues as a lack of agreement among the inspired
writers themselves--implying that the authority of theologians is on an equal level with that of
the inspired Bible writers. On the other hand, upholding the principle that Scripture interprets
itself suggests that when Bible students lack consensus, they must prayerfully continue
searching the Scriptures until God sheds further light on the issue.
Ellen White repeatedly emphasized, "Make the Bible its own expositor, bringing together
all that is said concerning a given subject at different times and under varied circumstances"
(Child Guidance, p. 511). "I saw that the Word of God, as a whole, is a perfect chain, one
portion linking into and explaining another" (Early Writings, p. 221). We must submit to "the
Bible as the word of God, the only sufficient, infallible rule," which "must be its own
interpreter" (The Great Controversy, p. 173). "Scripture interprets scripture, one passage
being the key to other passages" (Evangelism, p. 581). "The Bible is its own expositor.
Scripture is to be compared with scripture" (Education, p. 190).
Thus, when the canonical principle asserts that we must interpret Scripture in the light of
Scripture, the implications are that: (1) the information needed to understand a given passage
of the Bible can be found in the pages of Scripture itself, and (2) an obscure or difficult text
must always be interpreted in the light of a clear text dealing with the same subject in another
part of Scripture.
5. Consistent Principle. This principle of interpretation asserts that since the sixty-six
books of the Bible are ultimately the product of one Divine mind, the Bible is consistent with
itself, with no part contradicting another. This principle, also known as "the unity of
Scripture," was taught by the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformers and our
nineteenth-century Adventist pioneers.
This principle means that if "we hold an interpretation of one passage that does not square
with something in another passage, one of the passages is being interpreted incorrectly--or
possibly both of them."12
The consistent principle of interpretation grows out of the canonical principle of
comparing Scripture with Scripture. One verse traditionally used to illustrate this principle is
Isaiah 28:9-10: "Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand
doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. For precept must
be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little and there a
little" (cf. v. 13).
Higher critical scholarship has attacked this principle of interpretation, for two major
reasons. First, some have misused the practice, recklessly pulling a text out of its original
historical context. Second, historical-critical scholars believe that there is no unity in the
Bible, an essentially human document with little, if any, input from God.
Because liberal scholarship talks about "the diversity of Scripture" rather than the Bible's
unity, its followers dismiss anyone who insists upon comparing Scripture with Scripture as
practicing a "proof-text" or "key-text" approach. Ironically, those who disparage the principle
of comparing Scripture with Scripture find it valuable to compare Scripture with
extra-biblical materials they seems to consider more reliable than the Bible itself!
The consistency principle is extremely important for interpreting parallel accounts in
Scripture--some of which present differences in detail (e.g., 2 Sam 24 and 1 Chron 21; 2
Kings 18-20 and 2 Chron 32; Matt 21:33-44, Mark 12:1-11 and Luke 20:9-18). In studying
passages of this kind, the interpreter must make sure that the parallels refer to the same
historical events. For example, just as contemporary preachers and speakers often present the
same messages on different occasions to different audiences and with different wording, so
202
Jesus may have spoken some of His parables at different times, to different groups, and with
different wording and emphasis. Even when the gospel writers record the same events, each
Bible writer may emphasize different aspects of the events and in some cases may choose not
to mention some details (see Selected Messages, 1:21, 22; The Great Controversy, p. vi).
In other instances some dissimilarities may be due to minor errors of copyists (Selected
Messages, 1:16). Scholars can detect these by comparing various manuscripts. But sometimes
our present knowledge does not allow us to reconcile apparent discrepancies. In such cases,
rather than hastily declaring the differences to be contradictions or errors, the interpreter must
suspend judgment until more information and better evidence are available to resolve the
apparent discrepancy.
The consistent principle of interpretation holds that any interpreter "who says that the
Bible contradicts itself because it appears so to him displays his ignorance either of the
enormous competence of its author [God] or, in comparison, of his own abysmal ignorance
and displays an overconfidence which borders on arrogance."13
6. Christological Principle. Interpreting Scripture christologically means that the Bible
student must recognize Jesus Christ as the subject matter of Scripture, since everything in
Scripture bears witness of Him. Jesus Christ Himself said: "Search the scriptures; for in them
ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39). Christ is not
just the center, He is the focus of Scripture.
One seventeenth-century English Puritan aptly summarized the christological principle:
"Keep still Jesus Christ in your eye, in the perusal of the Scriptures, as the end, scope and
substance thereof: what are the whole Scriptures, but as it were the spiritual swaddling clothes
of the holy child Jesus? 1. Christ is the truth and substance of all the types and shadows. 2.
Christ is the substance and matter of the Covenant of Grace, and all administrations thereof;
under the Old Testament Christ is veiled, under the New Covenant revealed. 3. Christ is the
centre and meeting place of all the promises; for in him the promises of God are yea and
Amen. 4. Christ is the thing signified, sealed and exhibited in the Sacraments [ordinances] of
the Old and New Testament. 5. Scripture genealogies use to lead us on to the true line of
Christ. 6. Scripture chronologies are to discover to us the times and seasons of Christ. 7.
Scripture-laws are our schoolmasters to bring us to Christ, the moral by correcting, the
ceremonial by directing. 8. Scripture-gospel is Christ's light, whereby we hear and follow
him; Christ's cords of love, whereby we are drawn into sweet union and communion with
him; yea it is the very power of God unto salvation unto all them that believe in Christ Jesus;
and therefore think of Christ as the very substance, marrow, soul and scope of the whole
Scriptures."14
Thus the whole of the Bible prophesied, typified, and prefigured Jesus Christ. "The Old
Testament sheds light upon the New, and the New upon the Old. Each is a revelation of the
glory of God in Christ. Christ as manifested t the patriarchs, as symbolized in the sacrificial
service, as portrayed in the law, and as revealed by the prophets is the riches of the Old
Testament. Christ in His life, His death, and His resurrection; Christ as He is manifested by
the Holy Spirit, is the treasure of the New. Both Old and New present truths that will
continually reveal new depths of meaning to the earnest seeker" (Counsels to Parents,
Teachers, and Students, pp. 462, 463).
This is why it is reported of Jesus that, on the road to Emmaus with two believers after His
resurrection, "beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke 24:27, cf. 44-49). Can we imagine the
heart-warming experience that will be ours if we make Jesus the focus of our daily lives,
especially as we seek to find Him each time we study and meditate upon the Scriptures (cf.
203
Luke 24:32)?
Ellen G. White described the reward of such an exercise: "Memory's hall should be hung
with sacred pictures, with views of Jesus, with lessons of His truth, with revealings of His
matchless charms. If memory's hall were thus furnished, we would not look upon our lot as
intolerable. We would not talk of the faults of others. Our souls would be full of Jesus and His
love. We would not desire to dictate to the Lord the way that He should lead. We would love
God supremely and our neighbor as ourselves. When the joy of the Lord is in the soul, you
will not be able to repress it; you will want to tell others of the treasure you have found; you
will speak of Jesus and His matchless charms. We should devote all to Him. Our minds
should be educated to dwell upon those things that will glorify God; and if our mental powers
are dedicated to God, our talents will improve, and we shall have more and more ability to
render to the Master. We shall become channels of light to others" (In Heavenly Places,
p. 123; cf. The Ministry of Healing, p. 514).
7. Cosmic Principle. As an essential aspect of the christological principle, Seventh-day
Adventist interpreters of Scripture must see the events recorded in the Bible within the larger
context of the great controversy between Christ and Satan.15
Ellen G. White made this principle the key emphasis of her writings: "The central theme of
the Bible, the theme about which every other in the whole book clusters, is the redemption
plan, the restoration in the human soul of the image of God. From the first intimation of hope
in the sentence pronounced in Eden to that last glorious promise of the Revelation, 'They shall
see His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads' (Revelation 22:4), the burden of every
book and every passage of the Bible is the unfolding of this wondrous theme--man's
uplifting--the power of God, 'which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.' 1
Corinthians 15:57. He who grasps this thought has before him an infinite field for study. He
has the key that will unlock to him the whole treasure house of God's word" (Education, pp.
125, 126).
"The Bible is its own expositor. Scripture is to be compared with scripture. The student
should learn to view the word as a whole and to see the relation of its parts. He should gain a
knowledge of its grand central theme--of God's original purpose for the world, of the rise of
the great controversy, and of the work of redemption. He should understand the nature of the
two principles that are contending for the supremacy, and should learn to trace their working
through the records of history and prophecy to the great consummation. He should see how
this controversy enters into every phase of human experience; how in every act of life he
himself reveals the one or the other of the two antagonistic motives; and how, whether he will
or not, he is even now deciding upon which side of the controversy he will be found"
(Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, pp. 462).
8. Practical Principle. Interpreting the Bible practically suggests that once the meaning of
a text has been ascertained, it must be applied to the life of the interpreter (2 Tim 3:16-17).
The Bible is a practical book that addresses us in our concrete situation. It peaks to us as we
stand before God guilty, helpless, confused, in need of pardoning and sustaining grace.
Thus, the plain reading of Scripture does not stop at what a text meant to the original
readers, or what it reveals about Jesus. It also speaks to us in our relationships with others.
This phase of interpretation is often called application.
For example, in studying Bible characters, the history of Israel, and the early church, we
must avoid their mistakes and emulate their examples when they were consciously following
the Lord. Ellen G. White wrote: "Those who question why the word of God brings out the
sins of His people . . . should consider that it was all written for their instruction, that they
204
may avoid the evils recorded and imitate only the righteousness of those who served the
Lord" (Testimonies for the Church, 4:12).
We must apply the truths of Scripture to every aspect of our being, including our minds,
our wills, our motivating drives, and our condition.
When applying Bible truths to our minds, we must say: "In the light of what we have
discovered, we must not think in certain ways; if we have been doing so, we must stop."
Second, we must apply the Bible's truths to our wills, so that we can state: "The truth
presented shows us that we must not behave thus-and-so; if we have started, we must quit
immediately. Instead, we must behave in such and such a manner." Third, biblical application
must be made to our motivating drives, so that if we have been living the way we should, we
have every good reason to continue, or to change our ways, if we are not living in that way.
Finally, we must apply Scripture to our conditions. Here the logical question we must ask is:
"How do we stand in relation to the truth presented? Have we faced it, taken it to heart,
measured and judged ourselves by it? How do we stand in relation to the God who speaks it
to us?"16
9. Communicative Principle. The communicative or sharing principle calls for sharing
what one has discovered in studying the Scriptures.17 This can take several forms. For
example, the sharing can be done through a sermon, Bible study, testimony, witnessing,
classroom lecture, evangelistic effort, or apologetic writing. This principle calls upon the
interpreter to submit his findings to the correction, confirmation, and edification of his fellow
believers. Comparing one's interpretation with that of others within the worshiping
community, submitting it to their scrutiny and correction, is one way to reduce the effects of
one's blind spots.
While the Holy Spirit guides individual believers in their understanding of Scripture, the
Bible tells us that a more complete knowledge of God comes when one studies the Word in
partnership "with all the saints" (Eph 3:18). God gives spiritual understanding through the
Christian community. Responsible interpretation therefore demands that the Bible student
compare his understanding with the discoveries of other believers, from the first century
through the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformers, the eighteenth-century Puritans and
Methodists, the nineteenth-century Adventist pioneers, and twentieth-century Bible-believing
scholars.
This principle recognizes that we are not the only ones the Holy Spirit has been teaching.
Others, in earlier generations and in our own, have also been enlightened by the Spirit, and
we stand to benefit from their discoveries and mistakes. By studying the Bible in partnership
with other members of the church, the believer recognizes that God has entrusted different
gifts to different members of the church for the edification of the entire body (1 Cor 12).
Within this context of spiritual gifts the church must recognize those who are endowed with
such gifts as teaching, knowledge, wisdom, and discernment of spirits. The roles of
theologians, and elders/pastors (those who are "apt to teach") also become particularly
significant. In a worldwide church such as ours, these gifts are essential to our united
understanding of the Bible.
Reluctance to study the Bible "with all the saints" leads to "Lone Ranger-ism" in
interpreting Scripture--the spirit that says, "Ill go my own way without regard to what the
community of believers thinks." Studying the Scriptures "with all the saints" serves as a check
on our tendency to believe that we alone are guided by the Holy Spirit.
"God has not passed His people by and chosen one solitary man here and another there as
the only ones worthy to be entrusted with His truth. He does not give one man new light
contrary to the established faith of the body. In every reform men have arisen making this
205
claim. . . . Let none be self-confident, as though God had given them special light above their
brethren. Christ is represented as dwelling in His people. Believers are represented as 'built
upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
Cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in
the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit'
[Eph 2:20-22]" (Testimonies for the Church, 5:291, 292).
Furthermore, the Spirit's design that believers study His word "with all the saints" delivers
us from the tyranny of being tied to our own thoughts and our naive cultural conceits. It
enables us to recognize that the Holy Spirit is not active only in a few regions of the world, or
at the study of only a few scholars and church members, but that He is also leading other
believers (experts and non-scholars, without regard to gender, race or social status) to a clear
understanding of God's will in His written Word. It is as Christians study the Bible together
and share the Word with each other, not as solitary individuals or as groups of individuals
from particular regions of the world, that they are given understanding most fully.18
10. Confirmative Principle. For Bible-believing Seventh-day Adventists, there is one
other principle that flows out of the communicative principle: this principle suggests that one
must compare all interpretations to the insights of Ellen G. White.
Every Christian denomination respects the interpretative insights of leading figures in their
respective traditions. Lutherans pay attention to the works of Martin Luther, Calvinists look
to John Calvin, Methodists value the works of John Wesley, and liberals measure their views
against liberal giants. Thus, Seventh-day Adventists should not be embarrassed to take
seriously the works of Ellen G. White. Though Ellen White never studied Hebrew or Greek,
and though she had no Ph.D. in theology, her insights into Bible truth cannot be dismissed
lightly or even patronized as the private opinions of a nineteenth-century "devotional writer."
In fact, given their belief that Ellen White received the prophetic gift, Seventh-day
Adventists must value her theological insights more highly than any uninspired authority or
expert, whether church leader or scholar. Without exhausting or preempting the task of
serious biblical interpretation or exegesis, her expositions on any given Bible passage offer
inspired guidance to the meaning of the passage (see Evangelism, p. 256; The Great
Controversy, pp. 193, 595; Testimonies for the Church, 5:665, 682, 707, 708; Counsels to
Writers and Editors, pp. 33-35).
She herself described her two-fold function in the church as follows: "God has, in that
Word [the Bible], promised to give visions in the 'last days'; not for a new rule of faith, but
for the comfort of His people, and to correct those who err from the Bible truth" (Early
Writings, p. 78). The light God gave her, she explains, "has been given to correct specious
error and to specify what is truth" (Selected Messages, 3:32).
Notice that the writings of Ellen White are not to establish a new rule of faith apart from
the Bible. Rather, they have been given the church to "comfort" God's people (when they are
in the right path), to "correct" them (when they err from the truth) and to "specify" what is
truth (when they are not sure). With so many confusing, conflicting voices involved in
biblical interpretation, can anyone doubt the importance and urgency of the Spirit of Prophecy
in the hermeneutical enterprise?
Summary of Principles. The hermeneutical decalogue outlined in this section essentially
captures the historic plain reading approach of Bible-believing Adventists, the
historical-grammatical method found in the "Methods of Bible Study" report (see Appendix
C). Because such an approach to Scripture deals a blow to liberalism's higher criticism (the
historical-critical method), we should expect that scholars who favor the latter approach will
206
strongly oppose the "Methods of Bible Study" report, or at least that they will quietly ignore
it.19
Conclusion
The best way to summarize the thrust of this chapter of Receiving the Word is to quote a
statement from Ellen G. White: "As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life
is sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from God's word for
himself. As we must eat for ourselves in order to receive nourishment, so we must receive the
word for ourselves. We are not to obtain it merely through the medium of another's mind. We
should carefully study the Bible, asking God for the aid of the Holy Spirit, that we may
understand His word. We should take one verse, and concentrate the mind on the task of
ascertaining the thought which God has put in that verse for us. We should dwell upon the
thought until it becomes our own, and we know 'what saith the Lord'" (The Desire of Ages, p.
390, emphasis supplied).
Rightly dividing the Word requires that we take the following steps outlined in the above
statement:
(1) Make a commitment to study the Bible carefully;
(2) Pray for the Holy Spirit's enlightenment for correct understanding;
(3) Choose a verse (or a small section) at a time;
(4) Concentrate the thought (i.e., prayerfully reflect or meditate) on God's message;
(5) Find out what the passage means to you in your concrete situation;
(6) Having discovered "what saith the Lord," put it into practice.
These are some implications of receiving the Word and rightly dividing it. This does not
mean we shall find no difficulties in the Bible. The Bible itself tells us we shall. But
employing the principles of interpretation discussed in this chapter and summarized in the
1986 report "Methods of Bible Study," we shall be able to resolve some of the Bible
difficulties. In the next chapter, we shall employ these principles in wrestling with the Word.

Deception from learned persons: "There will be human wisdom to meet--the wisdom
of learned men, who, as were the Pharisees, are teachers of the law of God, but do not obey
the law themselves" (p. 98).
Deception through ignorance and folly: "There will be human ignorance and folly to
meet in disconnected theories arrayed in new and fantastic dress--theories that it will be all
the more difficult to meet because there is no reason in them" (p. 98).
Deception from false dreams and visions: "There will be false dreams and false
visions, which have some truth, but lead away from the original faith. The Lord has given
men a rule by which to detect them: 'To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
according to this word, it is because there is no light in them' (Isa. 8:20). If they belittle the
law of God, if thy pay no heed to His will as revealed in the testimonies of His Spirit, they are
deceivers. They are controlled by impulse and impressions, which they believe to be from the
Holy Spirit, and consider more reliable than the Inspired Word. They claim that every thought
and feeling is an impression of the Spirit; and when they are reasoned with out of the
Scriptures, they declare that they have something more reliable. But while they think that they
207
are led by the Spirit of God, they are in reality following an imagination wrought upon by
Satan" (pp. 98, 99).
Deception subtly disguised as truth: "Satan will work in a most subtle manner to
introduce human inventions clothed with angel garments. But the light from the Word is
shining amid the moral darkness; and the Bible will never be superseded by miraculous
manifestations. The truth must be studied, it must be searched for as hidden treasure.
Wonderful illuminations will not be given aside from the Word, or to take the place of it.
Cling to the Word, receive the ingrafted Word, which will make men wise unto salvation" (p.
100).

Chapter Ten
Wrestling with the Word
As we explained in Chapter Three, the three theological factions--radical liberals,
moderate liberals (accommodationists), and Bible-believing conservatives--claim to take the
authority of the Bible very seriously. The quarrel in the Christian church over biblical
authority and interpretation arises over how to handle the difficulties in Scripture.
All three contestants claim that in the face of biblical difficulties they allow the Bible to
speak for itself; but letting "the Bible speak for itself" apparently means different things to
liberals and accommodationists than it does to Bible-believing conservatives. The real issue
boils down to assumptions that are shaping Christians' attempts at wrestling with the Word.
Attitudes Toward Bible Difficulties. Bible-believing Christians take seriously the Bible's
claim to truthfulness. But when liberals and accommodationists come across difficulties in the
Bible, they do three things: (1) they declare the problems to be inaccuracies, contradictions or
errors. Then, to account for the alleged mistakes or contradictions in the Bible, (2) they
redefine the meaning of inspiration or the nature of the Bible to allow for the possibility of
mistakes or inaccuracies, and (3) they adopt various versions of the higher critical
methodology to interpret the scriptural difficulties.
Yet it seems that liberals or accommodationists do not always agree on what constitutes a
discrepancy or contradiction! Neither are they in accord over the nature of the Bible's
inspiration and the appropriate method of Bible interpretation, except to agree that the Bible
is not fully inspired, trustworthy, and authoritative. This situation has led to the confusion of
voices in the churches on almost every theological subject.
So we shall devote this chapter to some of the Bible difficulties historical-critical scholars
often bring up. Using the principles discussed in the previous chapter, "Rightly Dividing the
Word," we shall engage in wrestling with the Word. We shall take a closer look at other "quail
problems" (see Chapter One) that Bible-believing Christians often must deal with. But first,
let us offer some principles for handling Bible difficulties.
Handle Bible Difficulties Carefully
The Bible Contains Difficulties. While receiving the Word as the inspired, trustworthy,
and authoritative revelation of God's will for humanity, Bible-believing Christians recognize
that the Bible contains unresolved difficulties. In fact, the Bible itself teaches this. In 2 Peter
3:15, 16, we read: "Our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him
hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are
some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned wrest, as they do also the
other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
Notice three things from the above text: (1) there are some difficult things in the Bible; (2)
the "unlearned and unstable" deal with these Bible difficulties in illegitimate ways--they
"wrest" (twist or distort) the difficulties; (3) the distortion of these "things hard to be
understood" results in the "destruction" of such individuals and possibly those who follow
them.
If mishandling the Bible can cost one's salvation, it is important for Bible-believing
Christians to know how to handle Scripture's difficulties.
210
Guidelines for Resolving Bible Difficulties. More than half a century ago, R. A. Torrey,
one time dean of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, spoke for many Bible-believers on this
issue. In the following abstract from a sermon, Torrey gives seven important guidelines for
Christians facing Bible difficulties. These suggestions parallel Ellen White's insightful
discussion of the same issue in Steps to Christ (pp. 105 to 113). Torrey wrote:
"First of all, let me say, Let us deal with any Difficulty and every Difficulty we meet in
the Bible with perfect honesty. Whenever you find a Difficulty in the Bible, frankly
acknowledge it, do not try to obscure it, do not try to dodge it, do not evade it. Evasion never
pays. Be honest through and through; perfect honesty and frankness always win out in the
long run. . . . If you are really convinced that the Bible is the Word of God, you can far better
afford to wait for an honest solution of a Difficulty than you can afford to attempt a solution
that is evasive and unsatisfactory. Let us hate all manner of evasion and lying. A 'pious lie' is
the most impious and the most destructive of all lies.
"In the second place, Let us deal with any Difficulty we meet in the Bible with that
humility that becomes all persons of such limited understanding as we are. Recognize the
limitations of your own mind and knowledge, and do not for a moment imagine that there is
no solution just because you have found none. There is, in all probability, a very simple
solution, even when you can find no solution at all.
"In the third place, Let us deal with every Difficulty we meet in the Bible with
indomitable determination. Make up your mind that you will find the solution, if you
possibly can, no matter what amount of time and study and hard thinking it may require. The
Difficulties in the Bible are our Heavenly Father's challenge to us to set our brains to work,
and to keep them at work until we have solved the puzzle. Do not give up searching for a
solution because you cannot find one in five minutes or ten minutes or ten days. Ponder over
it and work over it for days if necessary. The work will do you more good than the solution
does. There is a solution somewhere and you will find it, if you will only search for it long
enough and hard enough. . . .
"In the fourth place, Deal with every Difficulty you find in the Bible with perfect
fearlessness. Oh! there are so many students of the Bible who have horrid skeletons and
frightful ghosts in the closets of their Bible thinking. There are passages here and there at
which they are afraid to look. . . .
"Do not be frightened when you find a Difficulty, no matter how unanswerable or how
inexplicable or how insurmountable it may appear at first sight. Thousands of men have found
just such Difficulties before you were born. Not only that, but they have seen this same
Difficulty that now frightens you. These Difficulties were all seen hundreds of years ago, and
still the Old Book stands. The Bible that has already stood eighteen centuries of rigid
examination, and also of incessant and awful assault, is not likely to go down before your
discoveries, or even before the discharge of any 'modern,' 'scholarly,' 'critical' guns (in which
they certainly use neither smokeless nor noiseless powder) nor before the poison gases of
'Modern Criticism' either, which is usually found to be only 'hot air' after all. To one who is at
all familiar with the history of 'critical' attacks on the Bible, the childlike confidence of these
self-sufficient 'modern' (destructive) 'critics,' who think they are going to annihilate the Bible
at last, is both amazing and amusing. . . .
"In the fifth place, Let us deal with the Difficulties we find in the Bible with
undiscouraged and untiring patience. Do not be discouraged in the least, if some Difficulty
that you discover, or that someone else fires at you, does not disappear at the first hour's
consideration of it, or in a day. Have you never had problems in other lines of study that you
could not solve even in a year? If not, you have never done any deep studying along any line.
211
If some Difficulty persistently defies your very hardest efforts to solve it, lay it aside for a
while and ponder other things. Very likely, when you come back to it, it will have
disappeared, and you will wonder how you were ever perplexed by it. . . .
"In the sixth place, and this is of tremendous importance, Deal with all Bible Difficulties
Scripturally. If you find an apparently staggering Difficulty in one part of the Bible, look for
some other passage of Scripture to throw light upon it and solve it. The best solvent of Bible
Difficulties is found in the Bible itself. Nothing explains Scripture like Scripture. That is one
of the countless practical proofs of the Divine origin of the Bible, that 'all Scripture is God
breathed.' . . . The entrance of God's words had given light; it had given understanding unto
the simple (Ps. 119:130).
"In the seventh and last place, Deal with every Difficulty prayerfully. It is simply
wonderful how Difficulties dissolve when one looks at them on his knees. It is an easy way to
'dissolve doubts' and explain 'dark sentences.' Daniel found it so many centuries and chiliads
ago (Dan. 5:12, cf. Dan. 6:10). There is a glorious alchemy about prayer that transforms the
darkest and most bewildering Difficulties into clear shining and illuminating truth, that
transforms 'stones of stumbling' into the many jeweled walls of the New Jerusalem, with its
endless day and 'no night there.' It is well, as you read your Bible, not only to pray, 'Open
thou my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law' [Ps. 119:18] but, also, 'Open
thou my eyes that I may see through the rough oyster shell of seeming difficulty to the
glorious pearl of lustrous truth within.' Not only does God, in answer to prayer, open our eyes
'to behold wondrous things' out of His law, but He also opens our eyes to look through a
Difficulty that before we prayed seemed impenetrable. One great reason why so many
'Modern Bible Scholars' have learned to be destructive critics is because they have forgotten
how to pray."1
Promise of Divine Illumination. We conclude from the foregoing that students of the
Bible have always recognized that some portions of the Bible are more difficult than others.
Not only does the Bible itself say so (Heb 5:12-14, 2 Pet 3:15, 16), but it also tells us how to
deal with these difficulties. Just as the Bible writers "enquired and searched diligently" those
things they could not understand (1 Pet 1:10-11; cf. 1 Cor 2:11; Dan 8 and 9), so should
Bible-believers begin the study of the Word with prayer: "Open thou mine eyes, that I may
behold wondrous things out of thy law" (Ps 119:18).
If Christians diligently search the Scriptures (John 5:39; Acts 17:11), God has promised:
"Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest
her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; then shalt thou understand the fear of
the Lord, and find the knowledge of God" (Prov 2:3-5; cf. Eph 1:17).
We shall now apply the above guidelines and those discussed in the previos chapter to
some of liberalism's most "disturbing" problems, praying that God sheds further light on His
inspired Word.
Wrestling with Some "Disturbing" Problems
Admittedly, in this chapter we are not able to deal individually with all the questions raised
by radical and moderate liberals. But at least we can attempt to show that there are alternative
approaches to the alleged difficulties. Let us look at a few Old and New Testament passages
often cited as evidence of the Bible's own internal discrepancies. At the end of this section we
shall suggest some resources dealing with other kinds of Bible difficulties.
Proverbs 26:4, 5. Scholars often cite these two verses as a striking instance of apparently
212
contradictory proverbs. The passages read:
"Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him yourself" (v. 4).
"Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes" (v. 5).
Are these two verses contradictory? If these were really inconsistent, would they have
been placed side by side? A careful reading of the texts suggests that both proverbs are
sounding a caution to those who are dealing with unreasonable people. The argument runs
somewhat like this: Sometimes your answer to a fool can make you look like a fool; at other
times, your answer will help him; therefore be careful how you answer a fool.
These proverbs bring out the dilemma that always faces those who seek to reason with the
unreasonable ("fools"). The experience of the Apostle Paul illustrates this dilemma. In 2
Corinthians 11:16, he says: "Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive
me, that I may boast myself a little." Yet in the next chapter (12:11), he writes: "I am become
a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in
nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing." Between 2 Corinthians
11:16 and 12:11, Paul found himself speaking as a fool, yet he knew that if he did not do so
his audience would have been confirmed in their foolish opinions. It is the same kind of issue
that the two proverbs are dealing with; there is no inconsistency between verses 4 and 5 of
Proverbs 26.
Deuteronomy 23:1-3. Scholars cite the first three verses of Deuteronomy 23 as three
disturbing examples of "minor" discrepancies in Scripture. By comparing each of these verses
with certain other biblical passages they try to show that the exclusions of "eunuchs" (v. 1)
"bastards" (v. 2) and "Ammonites and Moabites" (v. 3) "from the assembly of the Lord" were
later overruled in Isaiah 56:3-5, Judges 11:1, 9-10, 29, and Ruth 4:10-17, respectively. Is it
really so?
(1) Deuteronomy 23:1 excludes "from the assembly of the Lord" men whose reproductive
organs were mutilated. No reason is given. It may be that such a condition was an affront to
the gift of procreation; such mutilation could also have been a practice in pagan religions.
Whatever the reason, we can infer from Deuteronomy 14:1, 2 that this exclusion of eunuchs
was a specific application of the command to the Israelites not to mutilate themselves
deliberately, beause they were "an holy" and "peculiar people unto himself [the Lord God],
above all the nations that are upon the earth." As a holy people, the Israelites were not to
practice self-mutilation, the way the idol worshiping nations around them were doing. Doing
so would represent apostasy from the true God of Israel.
But in Isaiah 56:3-5 the prophet proclaims that "eunuchs" who were faithful to God
keeping His "sabbaths" and "covenants," might find an honored place in God's family before
those who were sound in body but who broke His covenant. Doesn't this contradict
Deuteronomy 23:1?
If we follow higher-critical scholars in rejecting the long-standing Adventist belief that
there is a harmony in the Bible's various parts, we might infer a contradiction. But if we
recognize the Bible as the product of a divine Author, and thus, as trustworthy and
harmonious in its teachings, then we can resolve the apparent difficulty by comparing
Scripture with Scripture.
Perhaps the eunuchs spoken of in Isaiah 56, having previously gone the way of their pagan
neighbors, had returned and renewed their relationship with the true God. Under the
circumstances, God takes them back and extends His blessing to such people (cf. Eze
18:20-32). In fact, the New Testament shows that an Ethiopian eunuch experienced this
213
salvation.
Thus, Deuteronomy 23:1 and Isaiah 56:3-5, when taken together, teach us that irrespective
of past background, if we seek a covenant relationship with God, He will accept us (Isa 1:18).
There is no contradiction between the two passages.
(2) In Deuteronomy 23:2, "bastards" are also excluded from the assembly of the Lord. In
Judges 11, however, "the Spirit of the Lord came upon" Jephthah the Gileadite, a "son of a
harlot." Apparently because in English today, a "bastard" typically refers to someone born out
of wedlock, some assume that the word "bastard" in Deuteronomy includes the "son of a
harlot" in Judges.
The alleged contradiction between Deuteronomy 23:2 and Judges 11 is another classic
example of liberal eisegesis, reading into the text what is not there by imposing meanings
upon the biblical text.
The root word translated "bastard" in Deuteronomy (mamzer) is uncertain in meaning. The
only other place that the word appears is in Zechariah 9:6. Rabbinic tradition holds that it
refers to a person "born of incest," a "non-Israelite," or a "stranger of unknown ancestry" who
holds to a foreign religion. If this is indeed the case, Jephthah does not fit the definition of a
"bastard" in Deuteronomy 23:2. But since Bible-believers do not take tradition (past or
present) as their final authority, and since the meaning of mamzer is presently uncertain, it is
only fair to withhold judgment on this passage until all available light is shed on the exact
meaning of the Hebrew word translated as "bastard."
(3) In Deuteronomy 23:3, the Ammonites and Moabites "even to the tenth generation" are
excluded from the assembly of the Lord. But in a different section of Scripture we learn that
Ruth, "the Moabitess," becomes the wife of Boaz and the ancestor of David (Ruth 4) and
therefore of Jesus.
Was the exclusion in Deuteronomy 23:3 overruled in Ruth 4? Does this apparent
"inconsistency" justify the liberal claim that in this "obvious contradiction," God is teaching
Christians to trust Him rather than an imperfect human Bible, or that He is able to make
something good (the roots of the Messiah) from the cultural prejudice of the writer of
Deuteronomy? It does not appear so.
Though the text is not explicit, it is very possible that like others in Scripture, this
command in Deuteronomy 23:3 is conditional, contingent upon the faith response of the
people of Moab and Ammon. For the purpose of argument, however, let us assume that the
command is not conditional. What light does Scripture shed on this issue?
The Ammonites and Moabites were the descendants of incestuous relationships between
Lot and his two daughters (Gen 19:30-38). The Bible does not give a reason for this
exclusion, even though we know that there had been hostility between these two nations and
Israel (Judges 11:4-33; 1 Sam 11:1-11; 2 Sam 10, etc.. We also know from the Scriptures that
at the time of the exodus, Israel did not conquer the Ammonites (Deut 2:19, 37; Judges 11:15)
and that both the Ammonites and the Moabites refused to offer hospitality to the Israelites
(Deut 23:4; cf. Num 22-24). How does the exclusion of the Ammonites and Moabites from
the assembly of the Lord "even to the tenth generation" relate to Ruth "the Moabitess"?
From the time of Moses to the time of Ruth was about 300 years. Is this period of time
equivalent to "ten generations"? The answer depends on the span of a generation. If we
understand a "generation" as equivalent to the average age at which persons "beget" (or
"generate") their firstborn, we learn from the Bible that, after the flood (Gen 11:10-24), the
usual age at which a man became a father (i.e., "begat" children) was around 30 years. Ten
generations would therefore be about 300 years, the period between Moses and Ruth!
In each of the three "disturbing" examples from Deuteronomy 23, the Bible itself gives us
the key. A careful investigation of the Scriptures may offer even better solutions to some of
214
the most troublesome problems.
2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21. These two accounts of David's census are often cited
as the classic examples of "obvious contradictions" in parallel biblical passages. The four
questions usually raised in connection with these two accounts are:
(1) Who ordered David's census? God (2 Sam) or Satan (1 Chron)?
(2) How many persons were numbered? 1,300,000 (2 Sam) or 1,570,000 (1 Chron)?
(3) At whose threshing floor was the angel of the Lord seen? Araunah's (2 Sam) or Ornan's (1
Chron)?
(4) How much money was paid? 50 shekels of silver (2 Sam) or 600 shekels of gold (1 Chron)?
Without attempting to trivialize the importance of biblical details, we offer some
explanations for the seemingly inconsistent accounts.
(1) Who ordered David's census? The "Who" of the census can be explained by referring
to God's permissive will in the affairs of the world. Examples can be multiplied in the Bible;
God's permission to Satan to afflict Job, the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, the choice of Saul
as king of Israel, etc.
In the parallel accounts in 2 Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21, (i) David was responsible in
the sense that he chose to displease God by having the census, even against the objections of
Joab; he later confessed his sin (2 Sam 24:10, 17; cf. 1 Chron 21:8, 17); (ii) Satan, the
adversary of God and His people, was also responsible in the sense that he was the one who
incited David; (iii) God was responsible in the sense that He permitted Satan to incite David.
(2) How many people were numbered? A casual reading of the two parallel passages will
reveal some apparent inconsistencies. The account in 2 Samuel reports that there were
800,000 armed men in Israel and 500,000 in Judah (totaling 1,300,000); the passage in 1
Chronicles gives 1,100,000 in "all Israel" and 470,000 in Judah (totaling 1,570,000). Not only
are the total numbers different, but the underlying figures for Israel and Judah are also
different. How do we account for this difference?
The Bible makes it clear that (i) this census that took Joab 10 months to conduct was not
complete, apparently because of the plagues that had set in (1 Chron 27:24). (ii) We are also
told that he did not number the tribes of Levi and Benjamin (1 Chron 21:6). (iii) The figure of
Chronicles with 1,100,000 for "all Israel" is larger than Samuel's 800,000, apparently becase
Samuel does not include the 288,000-strong standing army of David (1 Chron 27:1-15). Note
that there is no all before "Israel" in Samuel's account. Adding the 288,000 to the 1,300,000
total of Samuel's account yields 1,588,000, against Chronicle's 1,570,000. Interestingly, the
Chronicles total is the smaller; this same book says that Joab did not complete the census.
The point is that we need not ascribe "inconsistency" or "error" to the two accounts.
Indicators in the texts as well as the explicit statement of the Bible itself testify that the
numbers given are not complete.
(3) At whose threshing floor did the angel of the Lord appear? The names given in the
two parallel accounts, "Araunah the Jebusite" and "Ornan the Jebusite," may refer to the same
person. First, in the Bible, persons sometimes possess two different names (such as
Abram/Abraham, Jacob/Israel, Jethro/Reuel, Simon/Peter, Saul/Paul). Second, we need not be
surprised that Araunah could be the same as Ornan. The original Hebrew alphabet consisted
of consonants only. Vowel signs were not introduced until more than a thousand years after
Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament, was completed.
Thus, the Hebrew root letters for the name Araunah appear to have been 'rn and those for
Ornan likewise 'rn. The differences in vowels and ending may be due simply to the varying
215
pronunciations of the Jebusite's name at the time the accounts were recorded. The point is that
these two apparently different names are linguistically related, derived from the same root.
(4) How much did David pay? The two parallel accounts provide us with an answer. In 2
Samuel 24:24 we are told: "So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 shekels
of silver." In 1 Chronicles 21:15, "So David paid Ornan 600 shekels gold by weight for the
site." Are there any inconsistencies? Apparently not.
The Chronicles account tells of the cost of the site; this might be the entire site of which
the threshing floor was only a part. If so, we can understand why the site cost 600 shekels of
gold and the threshing floor only 50 shekels of silver. We do not, therefore, need to ascribe
inconsistency to the two accounts.
Approximations and Imprecisions As Alleged Errors
Errors charged to Bible writers by liberal scholars are often the result of approximations or
imprecision on the part of the Bible writers. We will cite a few examples.
The Alleged Mathematical Error in 2 Chronicles 4:1-2. How can the circular "sea of
cast metal" in Solomon's temple (2 Chron 4:1-2) have a diameter of 10 cubits and yet have a
circumference of 30 cubits, when we know from simple mathematics that the circumference
should be about 31.42 cubits (Circumference = p x Diameter, i.e., 3.142 x 10)? The
implication of this question is that, if the Bible writers could not be exact in this simple
mathematical problem, how can these inspired writers be trusted with complicated
computations of time prophecies (such as the 2300 years of Daniel 8:14) and other numbers
dealing with biblical chronology or genealogies?
What the critics fail to realize is that the Bible writer did not tell us whether the 30 cubits
figure given for the circumference of the basin is an approximate figure or an exact one.
While it is true that Circumference = p x Diameter, the value of p can never be an exact
figure. In other words, since p is an infinite non-repeating decimal (3.14159265+), any
approximation of p, either as 3.0, 3.1, 3.14, 3.142, 3.1416, 3.14159, or 3.141593, etc., is
technically in error. Thus, whatever figure the Bible writer uses to compute the circumference
could be declared an error by the critics. It is obvious that in the case of the laver in
Solomon's temple, the Bible writer could only have given an approximation of the
circumference (taking p as 3.0), just as all scientists today will have to approximate if they are
to compute the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 10 units.
But if the critics want us to be really picky, there is another way we can look at this alleged
mistake. Notice that all the Bible states is that Solomon "made the Sea of cast metal, circular
in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty
cubits to measure around it." What does "from rim to rim" refer to? Is it the inner diameter of
the basin or the outer one? Could it be that when he was referring to the diameter of 10 cubits
he had in mind the outer diameter but when he mentioned the 30 cubits circumference he had
in mind the inner diameter? Why not? A school-child can remind the critical scholars that the
circular basin, just like a salad bowl in mama's kitchen, has a thickness!
Our effort in going through this rather ridiculous exercise is to point out that we should not
ascribe "ignorance" or "mistake" to the writer of Chronicles when we are not told whether he
intended his mathematical figures to provide an exact scientific calibration or an approximate
measure of the size of the basin. Those who charge the writer of Chronicles with error
because he was not "mathematically precise" are also betraying their ignorance of basic laws
of engineering and physics. The fact is that while mathematicians can calculate the exact
measurement of a design in brass, it is always difficult for those in the workshop to shape a
216
metallic object to the exact specifications. The workshop engineers always do their
measurements to within a certain degree of error. And they also factor in the impact of
temperature changes to allow for expansion and contraction of the brass metal being used to
construct the object. The point is that the critics may need to reconsider the basis of their
skepticism.
The Alleged Error of Botanical Classification. Again critics charge the Bible with error
when it allegedly makes a wrong classification of plants. In 1 Kings 4:33, Solomon is said to
have spoken of trees, "from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that
springeth out of the wall." This is supposedly an instance of an inspired writer following a
"primitive" system of botanical classification according to size of plants, instead of following
our modern "scientific" system that is based on the structure of the flower. Critics attribute the
same kind of "error" to Jesus, who stated that the mustard seed "is the least of all seeds: but
when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the
air come and lodge in the branches thereof" (Matt 13:32). The question in this case is: Is the
mustard seed really the "least [smallest] of all seeds"?
The Bible-believing scholar asks: What makes one form of botanical classification (plants,
seeds, etc.) better than another? What determines whether, for example, one person's
classification of shoes according to size is better than another's classification according to
gender (ladies' versus mens'), age (children's versus adults'), color (red, black, brown),
material (leather, rubber, etc.), or even origin (Italian, Brazilian, Zambian, etc.)?
All classifications deal with an ordering system or pattern which serves the specific
purpose of the information or fact(s) being communicated. Is our classification of shoes (or
cas, clothes, apples, etc.) any different from the Bible characters' classification of plants and
seeds? Who decides whether one form of classification is "primitive" (because it is based on
external appearance using the naked eye) and the other "scientific" (using microscopes or
dissection, etc.)?
In the case of the mustard seed, should we fault Jesus for declaring it to be "the least of all
seeds"? Since there are microscopic seeds too small to be seen with the naked eye and far
smaller than the mustard seed, are we to conclude that in non-salvation issues Christ was
careless in handling truth? Rather than Jesus having made a "mistake," it is the scholars
themselves who are to be faulted for adopting a scientific definition of seed (sperma) that is
foreign to the context of Matthew 13:32. Liberal scholarship ascribes "error" (however
unintentional) to Jesus Christ only because it fails to recognize (1) the historical-cultural
context, (2) the literary-grammatical context and (3) the canonical context--three principles
we discussed in the previous chapter.
If historical-critical scholars had not imposed their ideologies on the Bible, they might
have recognized these three contexts. (1) In an agricultural community such as Christ's
audience, "seed" (sperma) in this setting would have meant anything farmers plant in the
ground to grow (not "a fertilized and ripened plant ovule containing an embryo capable of
germinating to produce a new plant," as one modern dictionary defines it). (2) In the verses
before and after Matthew 13:32, the word seed refers to that which a man takes and sows in
the field (vv. 24, 27, 37). (3) This meaning of seed in Christ's statement also appears in other
sections of the New Testament canon (comparing Scripture with Scripture).
We may thus conclude that in Matthew 13:32, Jesus does not even make an incidental
affirmation of factual error, neither does He "accommodate" the truth because of the "limited
scientific knowledge" of his hearers. All Jesus was conveying in His parable is that "the
mustard seed is such a tiny seed among the seeds you grow on the farm, yet when it grows it
becomes one of the largest garden plants." The New International Version captures this
217
understanding: "Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest
of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its
branches."
Alleged Error in Hosea 6:6. The prophet Hosea reports God as saying: "For I desired
mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings." According to
the critics this statement is another indication of blatant error. They ask: "If God doesn't want
sacrifice and burnt offering, why did He command the children of Israel to offer sacrifices and
burnt offerings to Him? Why did He ask Abraham to sacrifice his son as a burnt offering
Him? And why did He allow His Son to be sacrificed on the cross?" In the opinion of the
scholars, either God doesn't want sacrifice, in which case Jesus did not have to die as
atonement for our sins, or God wants sacrifice but He denies it, which implies that God
sometimes allows some forms of lying, as He Himself apparently does in the above verse.
Once again these skeptical questions and the spurious theologies they spawn are exotic
ways by which historical-critical scholars advertise their ignorance. They seem to forget that
the Bible was written by Hebrews, not by Americans, Europeans, or Africans. And since the
Scriptures were written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, they occasionally express some
thoughts in idioms that may be foreign to us.
The statement in Hosea 6:6 is an example of a Hebrew idiom, which the Bible itself
explains. In the book of Deuteronomy, forty years after God had made His covenant with one
generation of Israelites, Moses spoke to the sons and grandsons of that generation: "The Lord
made not this covenant with our fathers but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this
day" (Deut 5:3).
The fact is, however, that God actually did make a covenant with their fathers at Mt. Sinai.
In Deuteronomy 5:3 Moses employed a Hebrew idiom. What he was saing was this: "God did
not only make a covenant with our fathers, but also with us." An understanding of this
idiomatic expression by Moses leads us to understand Hosea 6:6 ("I desired mercy, and not
sacrifice") to mean: "I desired not only sacrifice, but also mercy."
Therefore, the alleged contradiction or error found in Hosea 6:6 arises out of the failure of
some modern scholars to appreciate idioms in the Hebrew language. It may also be an
indication of the cultural arrogance that leads today's critics to think that the expressions in
their language are superior to those of the Bible writers.
These alleged errors--ascribed to Bible writers because they employed approximations (the
circumference of the laver), another type of classification (of plants and seeds), and a
particular idiomatic expression (God desires mercy, not sacrifice)--are variations of the
"cultural conditioning" argument we identified in Part II of Chapter Five. Our response here is
the same: "the barbarian blindly asserts the primacy of his own temporal and cultural
provincialism in judging and understanding and interpreting all that occurs, and the learned
barbarian does precisely the same thing, but adds footnotes."2
The 600,000 Figure at the Exodus
This is probably one of the key "rational difficulties" often cited by critical scholars. If this
figure is an "exaggeration" of the actual number who left Egypt, why cannot other figures
cited by Bible writers be equally suspect? For example, if this figure is unreliable, how can
one reckon biblical genealogies or estimate that the age of the earth is "about 6,000 years"?
The Bible states that those who left Egypt at the exodus were 600,000 men, besides
women and children (Ex 12:37). Adding children and women will yield a figure close to two
million. In the course of the Israelites' journey, other censuses were taken that place the
218
number in the same range.3
Traditionally, scholars have questioned the accuracy of the two million number, saying
that it would have been impossible for such a large number of people to leave Egypt in a
single night, be sustained logistically in the barren desert, cross the Jordan in a day, march
around the small 10-acre city of Jericho, etc. Consequently, they have come up with all kinds
of approaches to reduce this large number of people in the exodus. Some have explained the
large numbers recorded in the Bible as due to "corruptions" in the text, such as transmission
errors, even though the present text shows no evidence of such. Others have suggested that
the numbers are symbolic or even represent the population of a later period.4
One Adventist scholar adds his voice to the popular conjecture that the word 'eleph,
translated "thousand," should be translated by its other meanings: family division (e.g., Josh
22:14); clan (e.g., 1 Sam 23:23; Micah 5:2), captain (Jer 13:21) or even ruler (as in Matt 2:6,
quoting Micah 5:2). In this way the 600,000 men (Ex 12:37) will mean 600 family divisions,
or 600 clans, or 600 captains or rulers--an explanation that makes the alleged "ambiguity" in
the numbers seem more reasonable to "analytical" minds.5
There is a problem, however: how does one translate 603,550 men? What do you do with
the 550? It is really fascinating to observe how creative scholars can be. They answer that
603,550 men is simply 603 clans consisting of 550 men! Thus the 601,730 men at the third
census (Num 26:51) is simply 601 clans with 730 men.
But there are three main lines of evidence from Scripture itself by means of
whichBible-believers may legitimately reject these critical reconstructions.6
In the first place, whenever the Bible employs 'eleph as a number ("thousand"), it is often
associated with me'oth, the word for "hundreds" as the next lower unit. For example, in
Exodus 12:37 me'oth ("hundreds") is in close association with 'eleph ("thousand"). Now, in
Numbers 1:21, the number of males in the tribe of Reuben is cited literally as "six and forty
thousand and five hundreds" [46,500]. In order for the critics to translate 'eleph as "clans" or
"family divisions," they have to translate the verse in two ways--either that the Reubenites
"were forty and six clans and five hundred" (i.e., a total of 546 clans, a figure the critics
themselves will not accept); or that there "were forty and six clans and five hundred men" (an
untenable liberal eisegesis since it requires the scholars to introduce the word "men," a word
that is not originally in the text).
Second, a comparison of the figures given for the first and second census recorded in the
book of Numbers (Num 2:1-32; 26:1-51) show that Moses understood 'eleph to be
"thousand"--not "clans" or "divisions." Here is how the Bible computes the numbers of the
various tribes:
Tribe First census Second census
Reuben 46,500 43,730
Simeon 59,300 22,200
Gad 45,650 40,500
Judah 74,600 76,500
Issachar 54,400 64,300
Zebulun 57,400 60,500
Ephraim 40,500 32,500
Manasseh 32,200 52,700
Benjamin 35,400 45,600
Dan 62,700 64,400
Asher 41,500 53,400
219
Naphtali 53,400 45,400
_______ _______
TOTAL 603,550 601,730
The Bible gives both the figures and the totals, and the result is mathematically correct.
Now if we follow the suggestion that instead of counting Reuben's number in the first
census as 46,500, we understand the 'elephs as 46 "clans" amounting to 550 men, we run into
some major problems. Adding all the tribes' "clans" (that is, 46 + 59 + 45 + 74 + 54 + 57 + 40
+ 32 + 35 + 62 + 41 + 53) should yield 603 'elephs or "clans," according to the total given in
Numbers 2:32. But it does not! Instead, we get 598 'elephs, suggesting that something is
wrong with this proposed critical approach. Similarly, if we follow the critics' suggested
solution, the second census figures will yield only 596 'elephs instead of the expected 601 of
Numbers 26:51. The problem is further compounded if we attempt to add the figures in the
me'oth or "hundreds" columns.
Third, in Exodus 38:25-28 (cf. 30:12), the Bible itself states that there came a time during
the exodus when each male was asked to pay a tax of half a shekel. Scripture records the total
amount of money collected from the half-shekel tax as 100 talents 1,775 shekels, i.e. 301,775
shekels. This works out to the exact amount of money to be expected from 603,550 men, each
taxed a half-shekel; in other words, 1/2 x 603,550 = 301,775! This close matching of men and
money ("about six-hundred thousand men," Ex 12:37) is possible only if 'eleph is understood
to mean "thousand"--not clan. This third reason is the most compelling argument dismissing
thecritical reconstruction of the biblical numbers.
The point is: The Bible states that the number of people during the exodus was
approximately 600,000 males (two million, allowing for women and children). There is no
reason to dismiss the biblical figures just because our "rational minds" have difficulty
accepting the explicit unambiguous claims of the Bible.
Our conclusion, on the basis of the Bible's own internal keys (the sum raised from the
tabernacle tax, and the unambiguous computation of the census figures) is that the word
'eleph in these figures should be translated as "thousands" and not as "clans" or "family
divisions." Hence the approximate figure of 600,000 males (or a total of about 2 million
people, women and children included) was the actual number of people involved in the
exodus. Once again, Ellen White was far ahead of the scholars when she stated that those who
"had come forth from Egypt" during the exodus were "millions" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
410).
Alleged Error of New Testament Writers
Quoting the Old Testament "Wrongly"
Higher critical scholarship sometimes asks: "How can we trust the New Testament writers
when they cannot even quote the Old Testament correctly?" The thrust of this rhetorical
question is that since the New Testament writers allegedly quoted the Old Testament
wrongly, the Holy Spirit evidently did not guide the accuracy of Scripture. This implies that
the Bible has some portions that are not inspired, and in this way it is no different from pagan
religious literature in which there is a mixture of truth and error. For other liberal scholars, the
allegation that the New Testament writers used the Old Testament "freely" (i.e. misused it)
suggests that modern scholars, "led by the Spirit," should also be allowed to use the Scriptures
"freely."
Two examples are often cited as indications of alleged wrong quotations of the Old
Testament. Before examining them, we will note that those who make these charges fail to
220
recognize that the Jewish writers did not follow the same literary standards employed today.
For example, they did not have quotation marks to distinguish a direct quotation (e.g.,
John wrote, "God is love") from an indirect quotation (e.g., "John has said that God is love").
They did not follow our standard of shortening a long quotation with an ellipsis (as in
"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy . . . the seventh day is the Sabbath"). Unlike the
practice in our day of using square brackets (e.g., "The seventh-day [i.e., Saturday] is the
Sabbath"), there is no way we can tell when the New Testament writers slipped in their own
comments in a quotation from the Old Testament. They did not have footnote or endnote
references by which to identify quotations from various sources. And there is no way we can
tell whether they were making direct quotes or mere paraphrases or allusions (e.g., "The Lord
is my shepherd and I shall have no need to worry about what to eat, drink, or wear"). In the
last example, unless it is known that we are simply paraphrasing or alluding to Psalm 23:1
and Matthew 6:31, someone may fault us for "wrongly quoting" either David or Matthew.
With this background, we shall now consider two New Testament examples critics have often
interpreted as mistaken quotations.7
Mark's Alleged Error in Quoting Isaiah "Wrongly." In introducing John the Baptist as
the forerunner of Jesus Christ, the Gospel writer Mark states: "As it is written in Isaiah the
prophet, 'Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way; the voice
of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare theway of the Lord, make his paths straight--'" (Mark
1:2, 3).
Mark actually quotes from two Old Testament sources. First, he quotes from Malachi 3:1
("Behold I send my messenger to prepare the way before me"), and only after that does he
keep his promise by quoting Isaiah 40:3 ("A voice cries: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of
the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God'"). Why does Mark "mistakenly"
attribute his quote to Isaiah?
Mark's allegedly wrong citation is actually the result of some twentieth-century scholars'
insistence that the first century Jewish writer must follow modern literary standards. In our
day, we may simply say something to this effect: "As far as John the Baptist is concerned, you
know what Isaiah the prophet (and, by the way, the later prophet Malachi also) has said:
'Behold, I send . . .'." Mark, however, does not follow our modern conventions. The original
recipients of Mark's Gospel understood his point. In citing his sources, he gives credit to
Isaiah, either because that was the major thrust of his argument, or because he was citing the
major prophet Isaiah as a representative of the Old Testament prophets who prophesied about
John in this manner.
Matthew's Alleged Error in Quoting "Wrongly." The same point can be made of the
alleged error of Matthew (27:9) in attributing a quotation from the prophet Zechariah to the
prophet Jeremiah (cf. Zech 11:12, 13; Jer 19:1-13; 32:6-9). To critics, this is a "classic
example" of an inspired writer (Matthew) having a lapse of memory, indicating that we
cannot always take them seriously.
Bible-believing scholars have responded with three possible explanations. First, the "error"
can be explained as creeping into the text during the transmission process. The idea here is
that a copyist may have inadvertently written the name of Jeremiah in place of Zechariah.
Perhaps, though there are more convincing solutions.
A second explanation takes into account the prevalent practice in Judaism to name a body
of works produced by two or more writers after the most prominent in the group. This is
analogous to politicians using the names London and Moscow in reference to the cities and
people of the United Kingdom and Russia. Thus, since Jeremiah is believed to be the more
221
notable of the two prophets, Matthew may have attributed the quotation to "the prophet
Jeremiah."
Assuming this is the case, does an instance of imprecision or approximation merit the label
"error"? Who decides whether one kind of language or description is better than another?
Should it be scholars in Washington and Paris, or those in Accra and Buenos Aires? This is
the old question of the alleged intellectual supremacy of Athens over Jerusalem, philosophy
over biblical revelation.
But while the second argument may be likely, it does not allow the entire sixty-six books
of the Bible to be the only context to understand Scripture. It reads the Bible in the light of
cultural practices in ancient times, not internal evidence in Scripture. This calls for a more
biblically-grounded argument.
The third explanation is much more likely. There are indications in the New Testament
text under consideration that Matthew quoted from both Zechariah and Jeremiah, but
attributed the quote to the more notable Old Testament prophet (Jeremiah). Matthew (27:9)
quotes from Zechariah when he states the amount paid to Judas for betraying Christ: ". . . the
handsome price at which they priced me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them
into the house of the Lord to the potter" (cf. Zech 11:13). But Matthew continues by
specifying the field of the potter, of which Zechariah makes no mention. Since the context of
Matthew 27:6-9 is about the chief priests of Jerusalem purchasing a burial plot using Judas's
bribe money, the inspired writer Matthew understood the significance of this in the light of
what Jeremiah had written.
Notice that Jeremiah also spoke of a burial plot near Jerusalem (Jer 19:2, 11), as well as
about the purchase of a field for a specified number of shekels (Jer 32:9). Thus, Matthew was
conflating statements from Zechariah (the actual cost of Christ's betrayal) and Jereiah (what
the betrayal money was used for, namely, to buy a burial field). Since Matthew quoted more
than one Old Testament author, he does what other New Testament writers do in instances of
this kind, that is, they cite only the more notable one. Thus, just as Mark (1:2-3) conflates a
quotation from Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3 but attributes it only to Isaiah, so in Matthew 27:9
the inspired writer cites only Jeremiah, even though he had conflated both Zechariah and
Jeremiah.
This is an instance where the Bible writers employed their own conventions in citing
sources. Can we fault them as mistaken because they do not follow our present system of
referencing sources, a system that is ever changing, even in our own time?
Apparent Contradictions in Parallel Gospel Accounts
Of the many allegations of contradictions or errors which historical-critical scholars offer,
the differences between the four Gospels are most cited as evidence that the Bible writers are
not trustworthy, since they do not seem to agree on certain points in their recording of the
same events.
Yet even if the Gospel writers recorded the stories exactly the same in every tiny detail, the
critics would still not trust them. They would conclude that the Bible writers collaborated in a
fishy scheme to remove all possible discrepancies. The point is that, because the
historical-critical method is established on skepticism, under no circumstance would its
followers trust everything they read in Scripture.8
In any case we still have to ask, What should the Bible student do in the face of apparent
contradictions in parallel accounts in the Gospels? For example, how many demoniacs met
Jesus at Gadara--one (Mark 5:2; Luke 8:27) or two (Matt 8:28)? How many blind men were
healed near Jericho--one (Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35) or two (Matt 20:30)? How many angels
222
were at Christ's tomb--one (Matt 28:5; Mark 16:5) or two (Luke 24:4; John 20:12)? We
cannot dismiss these questions as minor or inconsequential errors in matters of history; the
credibility and reliability of the Bible as God's inspired and trustworthy revelation is at stake.
One knowledgeable scholar compared the issue of the Bible writers' credibility to what
happens at court trials: "In a court of law, particularly in a criminal case, the trustworthiness
of a witness is of prime importance. The cross-examining attorney will make every effort to
prove that the witness cannot be believed, that he is not a truthful person. The attorney may
put various kinds of questions to the witness in an endeavor to trip him up in a discrepancy,
thus showing the jury that in one statement or the other the witness must be lying or confused.
Even though the discrepancy may pertain to a matter not directly germane to the case, the
jury's confidence in the witness's general credibility is necessarily shaken, and they may
reasonably reject his testimony relating to other, more important matters."9
Thus, if critics can show that the Bible writers are not trustworthy in even inconsequential
historical accounts, can we trust their testimony in the weightier aspects of doctrine or
salvation? Let us consider four examples.10
The Number of Demoniacs Healed. According to Matthew, there were two demoniacs
who came to Jesus, while Mark and Luke say that one approached Him. This is not an
instance of contradiction. It would have been a contradiction if Mark and Luke had stated that
there was only one demoniac. But they did not say so. In order for the texts to be
contradictory, the critical scholars would need to change the text, in which case the problem
would not rst with the Bible, but with the critics.
Besides, in order to claim contradiction, the critical scholars have to ignore a fundamental
mathematical law: wherever there are two, there is always one. No exceptions. Matthew tells
us that there were two demoniacs. Apparently, Mark and Luke mention one because he was
the more prominent of the two.
The Number of Angels at Jesus' Tomb. Matthew (28:5) and Mark (16:5) refer to one
angel at the tomb, while Luke (24:4) and John (20:12) indicate that there were two angels. Is
this a discrepancy? Only if we assume that Matthew and Mark claim that there was only one
angel, and only if we ignore the fundamental mathematical law that "wherever there are two,
there is always one." The situation is similar to the case of the demoniacs. We learn from two
of the gospel accounts that there were two angels. Since there were two angels, a gospel
writer may choose to focus on one. The fact that two of the writers focused on one angel does
not mean there was only one angel. The critics have to read something into the text to say that
Matthew and Mark allowed for only one angel.
Luke records that at the first approach of the women to the empty tomb, two angels
appeared to them. Matthew focuses only on one angel because, apparently, it was he who
caused the earthquake, rolled the stone door, frightened the guards, and spoke (he "said to the
women, 'Do not be afraid'"). John (20:11) indicates that Mary Magdalene came back to the
tomb a second time, after Peter and John had been there. It was then that Mary "saw two
angels" and spoke to them as they sat by the tomb. Thus, there were two angels involved,
although one was more prominent.
The Blind Men of Jericho. Here again, even though Matthew (20:29-34) records two men
healed while Mark (10:46-52) and Luke (18:35-43) speak of one, there is no contradiction.
Mark did not say there was only one blind man; and as we have pointed out, wherever there
are two, there is always one. Mark identifies one by name (Bartimaeus) and gives his father's
name (Timaeus), which suggests that he is concentrating on one of the blind men who was
223
well-known to him. Is it not natural, for example, that if two people receive a Nobel prize and
one of them is a personal acquaintance or from your home town, you will tend to focus on the
one you know?
Note that in the three examples above, each Gospel writer focused on aspects of the events
which he found most striking or meaningful. This is no different from the way we see things
in the Bible; though we may be reading the same passage, our different individual
dispositions, backgrounds, and experiences enable us to see different aspects of the same
truth. Even the way we express these truths (the vocabulary, expressions, etc.) will be
different. But we all gain a better appreciation of the truth when we share our perspectives.
Such is the case with the varying accounts of the Gospel writers.
Ellen White made this point clearly: "Written in different ages, by men who differed
widely in rank and occupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments, the books of the
Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in the nature of the subjects
unfolded. Different forms of expression are employed by different writers; often the same
truth is more strikingly presented by one than by another. And as several writers present a
subject under varied aspects and relations, there may appear, to the superficial, careless, or
prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or contradiction, where the thoughtful, reverent student,
with clearer insight, discerns the underlying harmony" (The Great Controversy, p. vi).
The Inscription on the Cross of Christ. Critical scholars often cite the different accounts
of the inscription on Jesus' cross as a case of "obvious discrepancy." How do we explain the
differences in wording?
Matthew 27:37: This is Jesus the king of the Jews
Mark 15:26: The king of the Jews
Luke 23:38: This is the king of the Jews
John 19:19: Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews
The explanation is not too difficult to find when we let the Bible speak for itself. Three
kinds of explanations are possible. First, according to John, the notice was written in three
languages--Hebrew, Greek and Latin (John 19:20). There is no indication in the Gospels to
suggest that the wording was the same in all three languages. It is quite possible that one
writer was giving us an exact copy of the Greek inscription while the others provided
translations of the Hebrew or the Latin version, or even perhaps a mixture of them both.
Second, there were no punctuation marks in Bible times, no quotation marks, brackets,
commas, etc. This can create problems for the modern reader who seeks to judge the Bible
writers by modern literary standards. Let us illustrate this with an example:
1. Direct Quotation: Pilate's inscription read: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
2. Indirect Quotation: Pilate wrote that Jesus was the King of the Jews.
It must be clear to the reader that even though the two sentences above are "quotations" of
Pilate, the use of quotation marks and a colon in the first example makes it easier for us to
know the extent of Pilate's exact words, even though both sentences convey Pilate's message
inscribed on the cross. This may shed some light on the alleged contradictions in the accounts
of the gospel writers regarding the inscription on the cross.
Finally, it is possible that each Gospel writer only gives part of the complete statement as
follows:
224
Matthew 27:37: "This is Jesus [of Nazareth] the king of the Jews"
Mark 15:26: "[This is Jesus of Nazareth] the king of the Jews"
Luke 23:38: "This is [Jesus of Nazareth] the king of the Jews"
John 19:19: "[This is] Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews"
It stands to reason that the whole statement may have been "This is Jesus of Nazareth the
king of the Jews." In this case each of the Gospel writers gives the essential part of the
message ("the king of the Jews"), but no Gospel gives the whole inscription. The important
thing to remember, even in this possible scenario, is that none of the Gospel writers
contradicted the other. Their accounts are diverse and mutually complementary, but not
contradictory.
Ellen White is on target again: "As presented through different individuals, the truth is
brought out in its varied aspects. One writer is more strongly impressed with one phase of the
subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with his experience or with his power of
perception and appreciation; another seizes upon a different phase; and each, under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, presents what is most forcibly impressed upon his own mind--a
different aspect of the truth in each, but a perfect harmony through all. And the truths thus
revealed unite to form a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of men in all the
circumstances and experiences of life" (The Great Controversy, p. vi, emphasis supplied).
What we have attempted to show in this chapter is that the alleged "inconsistencies" which
critical scholars claim to have found in Scripture are either misunderstandings of the text or
the result of wrong assumptions. If this is so, the efforts in some Adventist ranks to construct
new theories of Scripture inspiration and interpretation are misdirected and misleading.
Other Areas
The responses given here to these "difficult" passages are not intended to be the final word
on the questions. What we have simply sought to do is to suggest that there are other ways of
looking at these age-old problems masquerading in some minds as "disturbing discrepancies."
Whatever solutions may be offered for any biblical difficulty, Bible-believers must insist that
the Scriptures remain the final authority. Perhaps this exercise will convince us to suspend
judgment rather than declaring difficult passages of Scripture as "contradictions" or "errors."
The Bible should always reprove and correct us, not vice versa (2 Tim 3:16, 17).
Admittedly, the examples cited in this chapter do not exhaust the difficulties that some
readers may confront in studying the Scriptures. Because our concern has been with the
Bible's own alleged internal discrepancies, we have not dealt with problems relating to
modern science, ancient history, predictive prophecy, and ethical morality. Readers who want
to pursue these areas may consult the works cited in the note.11
We have also not dealt with the oft-repeated scholarly myth that the Old Testament
"accommodated" or tolerated (some say encouraged) polygamy, divorce and remarriage,
slavery, and "patriarchy," practices later allegedly corrected by the "Spirit's leading." Some
have already challenged these assertions.12 Another critical issue not dealt with in this book is
the issue of war and non-violence in the Bible. We hope to take this up in a future work.
Insightful Statements. Meanwhile, as we continue wrestling with the Word, we would
call attention to this insightful statement by Ellen G. White: "Many, especially those who are
young in the Christian life, are at times troubled with the suggestions of skepticism. There are
in the Bible many things which they cannot explain, or even understand, and Satan employs
these to shake their faith in the Scriptures as a revelation from God. . . . The difficulties of
225
Scripture have been urged by skeptics as an argument against the Bible; but so far from this,
they constitute a strong evidence of its divine inspiration. If it contained no account of God
but that which we could easily comprehend; if His greatness and majesty could be grasped by
finite minds, then the Bible would not bear the unmistakable credentials of divine authority.
The very grandeur and mystery of the themes presented, should inspire faith in it as the Word
of God" (Steps to Christ, pp. 105, 107).
Conclusion
It is fitting to close this chapter with timely counsel from Adventism's foremost Bible
interpreter:
"There are many things apparently difficult or obscure, which God will make plain and
simple to those who thus seek an understanding of them. But without the guidance of the
Holy Spirit we shall be continually liable to wrest the Scriptures or to misinterpret them.
There is much reading of the Bible that is without profit, and in many cases a positive injury.
When the Word of God is opened without reverence and without prayer; when the thoughts
and affections are not fixed upon God, or in harmony with His will, the mind is clouded with
doubt; and in the very study of the Bible, skepticism strengthens. The enemy takes control of
the thoughts, and he suggests interpretations hat are not correct. Whenever men are not in
word and deed seeking to be in harmony with God, then, however learned they may be, they
are liable to err in their understanding of Scripture, and it is not safe to trust to their
explanations. Those who look to the Scriptures to find discrepancies, have not spiritual
insight. With distorted vision they will see many causes for doubt and unbelief in things that
are really plain and simple."13
On the other hand there is abundant reward for Bible-believing Christians who approach
the Scriptures with humility of heart and a desire to obey God's revealed will. Through the
illumination of the Spirit, "God intends that even in this life the truths of His Word shall be
ever unfolding to His people. . . . God desires man to exercise his reasoning powers; and the
study of the Bible will strengthen and elevate the mind as no other study can. Yet we are to
beware of deifying reason, which is subject to the weakness and infirmity of humanity. If we
would not have the Scriptures clouded to our understanding, so that the plainest truths shall
not be comprehended, we must have the simplicity and faith of a little child, ready to learn,
while beseeching the aid of the Holy Spirit. A sense of the power and wisdom of God, and of
our inability to comprehend His greatness, should inspire us with humility, and we should
open His Word, as we would enter His presence, with holy awe. When we come to the Bible,
reason must acknowledge an authority superior to itself, and heart and intellect must bow to
the great I AM. . . . And all who come in this spirit to the study of the Bible, will find
abundant evidence that it is God's Word, and they may gain an understanding of its truths that
will make them wise unto salvation" (Steps to Christ, pp. 109, 111).
Such will be the attitude of all those who seek to honor the inspired and authoritative Word
of God. Because they have seen the bankruptcy of liberalism's skepticism towards the Bible,
they reject any use of the historical-critical method. Testimonies of such scholars will be
encouraging to us in our struggles with Bible difficulties. In the next chapter, we shall hear
courageous individuals testifying about the Word.

3. The first census, involving all the people over 20 years, was commanded by God for
the purpose of taxing them half a shekel each for the building of the tabernacle (Ex 30:11-16;
38:25f.). The number then was 603,550. The same number was obtained in a second census
(Num 1:1-54) some nine months after the first census; in this second instance the purpose was
to determine the number of people eligible for war. There was a third census, totalling
601,730 (Num 26:51) taken nearly forty years later, for the purpose of distributing the land of
Canaan. What is clear is that the number of people from the time of their departure from
Egypt to the time of their arrival in the promised land was over 600,000 males, or about 2
million in all (cf. Num 2:32; 11:21).
4. Many faithful Bible readers, however, have taken these numbers at face value. Their
faith rests in the assurance that "our God is able" (Dan 3:17). They argue that if God was able
to rescue the Israelites from the hands of the Egyptian forces, if He as able to part the Red
Sea, to provide manna to feed them and water from the rock, and if He was able to shelter
them by day and night with His presence in the pillar of cloud and fire (Ps 105, 106), would it
have been difficult for Him to deliver some 600,000 men from Egypt? Their faith response is
unequivocally, "There is nothing too hard for the Lord." This may sound childish to some; but
even a small figure of 20,000 would easily have perished from hunger and thirst in that
wilderness just as quickly as 600,000 men. Why do we have to believe in a "miracle" with a
reduced number and not exercise the same faith in a "miracle" with a large number, just as the
Bible says?

Chapter Eleven
Testifying about the Word
Though skeptical approaches to Scripture abound among scholars, many in the academic
community do not follow those approaches but take a reverent, believing attitude toward
Scripture. Some, even among world-class scholars who have been intimately acquainted with
such issues as this book raises, have converted from skepticism to faith. Their experiences
with liberalism's higher criticism may be instructive to those in our ranks who are tempted to
employ the historical-critical method or who may already be infatuated with it.
Since both classical and moderate liberals are sowing doubts concerning the Word (see
Chapter Three), we shall listen first to the testimonies of some former representatives of both
groups. Then, as a model for Bible-believing scholars in an increasingly liberal environment,
this chapter, "Testifying About the Word," will close with the testimony of a noted
Bible-believing conservative scholar.
But since every road has a destination, as a prelude to these testimonies we shall briefly
point out the ultimate destination of those travelling on the hermeneutical road of theological
liberalism. By showing how modern higher criticism bankrupts Christian theology and leads
away from faith in God, the Bible's Author, we may enable the reader better to detect winds
of liberalism wherever they may blow.
Liberalism: The Critical Voices Within
Theology as taught in most seminaries and universities today is based on theological
liberalism's historical-critical method. Many scholarly commentaries, articles, and books
reflect this method, and it also filters down to the pulpits. Unfortunately, church members,
students, and leaders--those who are most affected by it--are not always clearly aware of it.
Liberalism is not a school of thought in the sense of reflecting a uniform set of beliefs.
Rather, it is a frame of mind that seeks to adapt religious ideas to modern culture. One scholar
defined it well, saying that in liberalism, "a God without wrath brought men without sin into a
kingdom without judgment through the ministrations of a Christ without a cross."1
Essential Characteristics of Liberalism
Moderates/accommodationists who are still aboard the historical-critical train must be
aware that this train will ultimately lead them to the same destination as the radical liberals.
We shall highlight five elements that indicate when riders of this train have finally arrived at
the destination anticipated by its liberal engineers.
An Immanent Worldview. Ultimately the liberal worldview has no supernatural realm.
God is within nature rather than beyond it, working through natural processes (e.g. evolution)
rather than through radical discontinuities with it (e.g. special six-day creation). In theological
talk, this worldview is called immanence; both pantheism and the New Age philosophy are
versions of the immanent worldview.
In this worldview, there can be no true supernatural miracles such as the Bible teaches.
229
Therefore when liberal scholars use the term "miracle," we must understand that they mean
something completely different. In fact, Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), the
acknowledged father of modern liberalism, redefined miracles this way: "Miracle is simply
the religious name for event. Every event, even the most natural and usual, becomes a miracle
as soon as the religious view of it can be the dominant."2
Thus when liberals write about the "miracle" of Jesus' virgin birth, they understand this
birth as a "miracle" only because every birth is a miracle in itself. In other words, since every
birth is a unique and distinctive event, Jesus' birth is also unique, hence a "miracle."
This is a typical liberal approach: take a biblical term (inspiration, incarnation,
resurrection, Sabbath, sanctuary, atonement, etc.), empty the term of its biblical meaning, and
then inject it with a liberal meaning. In this way, unsuspecting church members will not
readily see the difference.
An "Inspiring" View of the Bible. When liberals say that they believe in the "inspiration"
of the Bible (or Ellen White), they often actually mean that the Bible is inspired in the same
way that Shakespeare is inspired. The Bible, liberals argue, though a fallible human product,
is an inspiring document just like any other outstanding work--whether it be music by
Beethoven, a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr., a sermon by Spurgeon, a lecture by Ghandhi,
a ministry like that of Mother Theresa, or leadership by Joan of Arc. God can still use a
fallible human work to unfold "truth" and effect a "dynamic, living revelation" of Himself.
For liberals, the Bible is culturally conditioned. It is a fallible human record of the writers'
religious experiences rather than a divine revelation of truth and reality. Consequently, the
Bible is not the authoritative norm on which Christians ought to base all their doctrines or
practices. The statement of Gordon Kaufman, describing the demise of biblical authority, may
well represent the views of many liberals: "The Bible no longer has unique authority for
Western man. It has become a great but archaic monument in our midst. It is a reminder of
where we once were--but no longer are. It contains glorious literature, important historical
documents, exalted ethical teachings, but it is no longer the word of God."3
Without an authoritative biblical norm, human reason and experience constitute
liberalism's highest norms. Because reason and experience may differ from person to person
and culture to culture, liberalism proposes that a pluralism of ideas or doctrines offers the best
hope of arriving at truth.
This means that, in the church, everyone must be permitted to believe and teach whatever
they please, even if contrary to the teachings of the Bible. After all, liberals argue, even in the
Bible there is "diversity" in the teachings of the Bible writers. The liberal mantra is: "Paul
became a Jew to the Jews and a Greek to Greeks." On this basis they argue that the church
should allow pluralism in doctrine and practice--as long as no one is hurt.4
Divinity of Human Beings. According to liberal theology, human beings are not
intrinsically evil as the Bible teaches; they are naturally good. This view is based on the
evolutionary idea of human progress. According to the father of modern liberalism, "sin is so
little an essential part of the being of man that we can never regard it as anything else than a
disturbance of nature."5 Many liberals would maintain that all human beings possess a divine
God-consciousness within them, which they themselves can develop, without any need of a
radical transformation by grace from outside.
Since human nature is essentially good, liberal scholars tend not to talk about human
sinfulness (the consequence of Adam's fall and our individual choices) or conversion (the
radical change in our nature), but a psychological "nurturing" (gradual development of one's
potential).
230
They also teach that the fundamental human problem is not sin but the environment
surrounding us--whether it is our genes, natural environment, or socio-political realities. If we
can change the order of society, we will reach utopia, experiencing "God's kingdom on earth."
This has led to an uncritical embracing of different versions of liberation theology (e.g.,
Western social gospel theologies, Latin American, African, Asian, feministic, gay and lesbian
liberation theologies).
This is why liberals are more interested in social or political activities than in evangelism.
Why evangelize when everybody has the truth or when no one can be sure of what truth is,
anyway? and when everyone is good already? For liberals, God is active not only in the
church, but also in political activity and other social movements.6 Thus in liberalism, there is
no place for a second coming of Jesus, a new heaven, or divine judgment. Human beings can
create their own utopia on earth. They do not need a God from outside to reward or punish.
The Man Jesus Christ. Christianity teaches that though divine, Jesus became human; God
became man. But in liberalism, Jesus Christ was a man who became God. He is not the
preexistent Son of God; He was a good man who developed his God-consciousness to the
highest degree, and therefore became God.7 Since all human beings possess the same
God-consciousness within them, they also can become God. This is essentially Satan's first
theology lecture in the garden of Eden.
Liberals also hold that the substitutionary death of Jesus on the cross was not an atonement
for the world's sins, but rather, it is an example of self-sacrificing, philanthropic love. They
maintain that the notion that the blood of Jesus was shed for the sins of others is a primitive
idea, offensive to today's "enlightened" thought and "matured" or "progressive" ethical
sensitivities.
Ideology over Methodology. Biblical Christianity calls upon believers to accept the
totality of Scripture and to submit humbly to its teachings. But liberalism, for ideological
reasons, refuses to surrender to the full authority of the Bible. Thus, in practice, liberal
interpretation of Scripture is not faithful biblical methodology but a battle for the supremacy
of conflicting secular ideologies.
The title of Eta Linnemann's book, Historical Criticism of the Bible: Methodology or
Ideology?, alludes to this point.8 Another scholar asserts it more explicitly, arguing that, in the
view of many contemporary theologians, the continuing authority of the Bible for today's
world depends upon how we address two related issues: "the ideological use of Scripture,
which is, if you will, an exterior problem; and the ideological content of Scripture, which is
intrinsic to the text."9
Theologies of Liberation. The various theologies of liberation provide an example of
ideological use of Scripture. They claim that powerful groups (e.g., the rich, white
Anglo-Saxons, heterosexuals, and males) have employed the Bible to legitimize exploiting,
dominating, and enslaving the socially powerless classes (e.g., the poor and marginalized,
people of color, females, and homosexuals), and they profess to deliver the Bible into the
hands of the oppressed as a resource for liberation, thus "correcting" the abuse. Such an
ideological hermeneutic uses the biblical data selectively, choosing only those sections it can
interpret to justify liberation from society's oppressive structures.
To succeed in their reinterpretation of the Bible, many theologies of liberation--e.g., the
social gospel, Latin American, Black, African, Asian, feminist, and gay and lesbian liberation
theologies--adopt the historical-critical approach to Scripture. As Linnemann explains, the
method's basic objective is to conduct biblical research as if there were no God.10 Denying the
traditional understanding of the Bible's inspiration in favor of "dynamic revelation" or
231
"dynamic truth," theologians of liberation dismiss as culturally conditioned any teaching in
the Bible that runs contrary to their secular ideology. Ultimately, human reason and
subjective experience become the final norm for liberal scholars.
Feminist Theology. Of the various brands of liberation theology, twentieth-century
feminist theology is notable for accusing Scripture itself of oppressive ideological content.
For this reason, it poses one of the greatest threats to biblical Christianity. One scholar has
accurately explained that whereas other liberation theologies claim the Scriptures have been
used to legitimize oppression (hence the need by liberation theologians to "liberate" the Word
from its white, Anglo-Saxon abusers), feminism perceives the Bible itself as both a producer
and product of female oppression--that is, some of the Bible's content is itself oppressive! She
aptly summarized the view of feminist theologians:
"The Bible was written in a patriarchal society by the people, mostly men, whom the
system kept on top. It embodies the androcentric, that is, male-centered, presuppositions of
that social world, and it legitimizes the patriarchal, that is male-dominant, social structures
that held that world together. Its language is overwhelmingly male-oriented, both in its
reference to God and in reference to people. In short, the Bible is a book written by men in
order to tell their story for their advantage. As such, it confronts both women and
justice-inspired men with an enormous problem. It is not at all certain that the Bible can
survive this challenge, that it can retain the allegiance of people called to justice and freedom
in a postmodern world."11
Holding that Scripture contains oppressive material against women, feminist interpreters
not only pick and choose from the Bible (as their other liberation theology counterparts do),
but they are also suspicious of the biblical text. Using the two principles of selectivity and
skepticism, feminist interpreters insist that as they approach Scripture, "our ideology takes
precedence over the ideology of the [biblical] literature."12 This attitude of both doubt and
scorn toward the Bible's message is an essential hallmark of the feminist hermeneutic.
Feminism's threat to Christianity stems, in part, from the fact that its influence is more
widespread than is often realized. Mary A. Kassian's eye-opening book, The Feminist Gospel:
The Movement to Unite Feminism With the Church (a "must read" for all Bible-believing
Seventh-day Adventists--lay people, pastors, and scholars),13 convincingly shows that besides
shaping contemporary discussions of male and female roles in the home and the church,
feminist philosophy also finds expression in various denominations through their women's
task forces, in colleges and universities through women's studies courses, in churches through
women's ministries, in seminaries through feminist theologies, and in worship expression
through inclusive language in hymns and Bible translations and through feminist rituals in
liturgies. Few realize, however, that behind most of the preoccupations of the various
women's groups, studies, and ministries lurks an agenda which seeks to reinterpret the
Christian faith and lifestyle.
Could this ideological agenda, and the desire to obliterate gender role differentiations, be
the underlying reason why, despite her favorable disposition towards legitimate women's
causes and ministries, Ellen G. White cautioned against the feminist movement of the 19th
century, known then as the "woman's rights movement"? She warned that "those who feel
called out to join the movement in favor of woman's rights and the so-called dress reform
might as well sever all connection with the third angel's message. The spirit which attends the
one cannot be in harmony with the other. The Scriptures are plain upon the relations and
rights of men and women" (Testimonies for the Church, 1:421).14
In short, liberalism has substituted a religion of immanence for the Christian faith. Instead
of the Messia Jesus, liberals have a religious hero or martyr; instead of creation from nothing
(ex nihilo), they have evolution; instead of an eschatology in which God Himself intervenes in
232
human history, they have the philosophy of human progress and utopianism; instead of the
absolute authority of the Bible, they have relativism and pluralism of ideas; and instead of a
faithful biblical methodology, they have profane secular ideologies.15
Bankruptcy of Liberalism and Its Method. Following the example of their Savior,
Bible-believing Christians reject the liberal position on the Bible and the atheistic
assumptions upon which the historical-critical method of interpretation is based. Recognizing
these so-called "scientific" methods as nothing more than false human structures, "hollow and
deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition" (Col 2:8 NIV) and "every
pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God" (2 Cor 10:5 NIV), true Christians
respond, "How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to
obtain the praise that comes from the only God?" (John 5:44 NIV).
One respected scholar summarized the baneful effect of liberal theology this way: "It raises
a doubt about every single biblical passage, as to whether it truly embodies revelation or not.
And it destroys the reverent, receptive, self-distrusting attitude of approach to the Bible,
without which it cannot be known to be 'God's Word written'."16 He explained that the loss of
the historic conviction that the Bible in its entirety is God's word has undermined preaching,
undercut Biblical teaching, weakened the faith of believers, discouraged lay Bible reading,
and saddest of all, has hidden Christ from the view of many Christians.17
Ellen G. White had liberals in mind when she wrote: "Men are teaching for doctrine the
commandments of men; and their assertions are taken as truth. The people have received
man-made theories. So the gospel is perverted, and the Scripture misapplied. As in the days of
Christ, the light of truth is pushed into the back-ground. Men's theories and suppositions are
honored before the word of the Lord God of hosts. The truth is counteracted by error. The
word of God is wrested, divided and distorted by higher criticism. Jesus is acknowledged,
only to be betrayed by a kiss" (Bible Echo and Signs of the Times, February 1, 1897).
Recognizing the dangers involved, Ellen White urged believers, "Brethren, cling to your
Bible, as it reads, and stop your criticisms in regard to its validity, and obey the Word, and not
one of you will be lost" (Selected Messages, 1:18).
Further, she urged: "The life of God, which gives life to the world, is in His word. It was
by His word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons. And by His word He stilled the
sea and raised the dead; and the people bore witness that His word was with power. He spoke
the word of God, as He had spoken it to all the prophets and teachers of the Old Testament.
The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ. It is our only source of power. Do not rely upon
any human agency for your wisdom. Take the Lord at His word, believing you do receive the
things you ask of Him" (Manuscript Releases, 11:29).
Testimony of A Former Liberal Scholar
Liberalism is incompatible with the biblical faith. Wherever it is accepted, it devastates the
faith of its recipients. It reduces the Bible to a dead letter, unable to bring life and meaning to
the hearts of people. Many Christians who have been infatuated by this kind of theology have
had to resort to secular psychology, sociology, socialism, and other "isms" in their attempt to
find meaning.
The most scathing criticism of liberalism's historical-critical theology comes from the
German New Testament scholar, Dr. Eta Linnemann, once among liberalism's ablest
defenders. Listen to the testimony of this Lutheran scholar as she explains why she gave up
liberal theology:
"'Why do you say "No!" to historical-critical theology?' I have been confronted with this
233
question, and I wish to state at the outset: My 'No!' to historical-critical theology stems from
my 'Yes!' to my wonderful Lord and Savior Jess Christ and to the glorious redemption he
accomplished for me on Golgotha.
"As a student of Rudolf Bultmann and Ernst Fuchs, as well as of Friedrich Gogarten and
Gerhard Ebeling, I had the best professors which historical-critical theology could offer to
me. And I did not do too badly in other respects, either. My first book turned out to be a
best-seller. I became professor of theology and religious education . . . [and] was inducted
into the Society of New Testament Studies. I had the satisfaction of an increasing degree of
recognition from my colleagues.
"Intellectually comfortable with historical-critical theology, I was deeply convinced that I
was rendering a service to God with my theological work and contributing to the
proclamation of the gospel. Then, however, on the basis of various observations, discoveries,
and a resulting self-awareness, I was forced to concede two things I did not wish: (1) no 'truth'
could emerge from this 'scientific work on the biblical text,' and (2) such labor does not serve
the proclamation of the gospel. . . .
"Today I realize that historical-critical theology's monopolistic character and world-wide
influence is a sign of God's judgment (Rom. 1:18-32). God predicted this in his Word: 'For
the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own
desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears
want to hear' (2 Tim. 4:3). He also promised to send a 'powerful delusion so that they will
believe the lie' (2 Thess. 2:11). God is not dead, nor has He resigned. He reigns, and He is
already executing judgment on those who declare him dead or assert that He is a false god
who does nothing, either good or evil.
"Today I know that I owe those initial insights to the beginning effects of God's grace. . . .
Finally God himself spoke to my heart by means of a Christian brother's words. By God's
grace and love I entrusted my life to Jesus.
"He immediately took my life into his saving grasp and began to transform it radically.
"I became aware of what folly it is, given what God is doing today, to maintain that the
miracles reported in the New Testament never took place. Suddenly it was clear to me that my
teaching was a case of the blind leading the blind. I repented for the way I had misled my
students. . . .
"By God's grace I experienced Jesus as the one whose name is above all names. I was
permitted to realize that Jesus is God's Son, born of a virgin. He is the Messiah and the Son of
Man; such titles were not merely conferred on Him as the result of human deliberation. I
recognized, first mentally, but then in a vital, experiential way, that Holy Scripture is inspired.
"Not because of human talk but because of the testimony of the Holy Spirit in my heart, I
have clear knowledge that my former perverse teaching was sin. At the same time I am happy
and thankful that this sin is forgiven me because Jesus bore it on the cross.
"That is why I say 'No!' to historical-critical theology. I regard everything that I taught and
wrote before I entrusted my life to Jesus as refuse [garbage]. I wish to use this opportunity to
mention that I have pitched my two books . . . along with my contributions to journals,
anthologies, and Festschriften. Whatever of these writings I had in my possession I threw into
the trash with my own hands in 1978. I ask you sincerely to do the same thing with any of
them you may have on your own bookshelf."18
This is the testimony of retired professor, Dr. Eta Linnemann, dated July 5, 1985. It was
my privilege to listen to this famed Christian scholar as she gave the testimony of her
conversion from liberalism to Christianity to members of the Adventist Theological Society,
and later to the students and faculty of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at
Andrews University.19
234
Tragically, many scholars, unlike Dr. Linnemann, are not willing to say a complete "No"
to historical-critical theology. To them liberal theories have attained the status of idols to
which they feel forced to bow. Scholars who choose to move against these popular liberal
tides are often termed "hopeessly uninformed," "blinded by a combination of ego needs and
naivete," "narrow minded," "anti-intellectual," "pre-scientific," and "fundamentalistic."20
The fear of being so labeled and the pressure for recognition as "open-minded,"
"progressive," or "enlightened" scholars has led some otherwise splendid Christian scholars to
adopt these pagan theories of the Bible. These scholars we have identified as
accommodationists or moderate liberals. If radical liberals are "the critical voices" in the
church, accommodationists/moderate liberals are "the confusing voices."
Accommodationism: The Confusing Voices Within
Accommodationism is old-fashioned liberalism in new and respectable garb. As we
explained in Chapter Three, "The only significant difference between the new Liberalism and
the old seems to be that the former lays more stress than did the latter on the importance of
believing the more or less mangled Bible that comes out of the critical mincing-machine."21
Accommodationism's evangelistic strategy seeks to make Christianity more palatable to
secular (naturalistic) minds. But in doing so it jettisons some portions of Scripture as
non-essential.
This strategy is seriously flawed. It makes human reason sit in judgment over Scripture
and, using its own criteria, decide what is necessary and what is not. By making human
judgment the arbiter of divine truth, accommodationism fails to recognize the limitations of
human reason. By choosing not to "totally subject human reasoning to the higher authority of
the Bible," as an Adventist scholar once wrote to me, the accommodationist may expect to
question everything in the Bible that does not agree with his or her rational deductions. And
because the spiritual diet served by such pick-and-choose theologians is so deficient in
nutritional value, they are tempted to chase after vitamin supplements from the pharmacies of
science, philosophy, sociology, psychology, and other extra-biblical sources.
Testimony of a Former Accommodationist Theologian
The experience of Dr. Thomas C. Oden, Methodist minister and professor of theology and
ethics at Drew University, may well illustrate that of scholars who flatter themselves that by
accommodating Bible truth to every new fad in science, psychology, sociology, etc., they can
attract unbelievers to Christianity. This is how he begins the chronicle of his pilgrimage:22
"I will describe a particular individual, an ordained theologian whom I have known for a
long time and whose career until recently can only be described as that of a 'movement
person.' If I appear to go into needless detail about this person, it is nonetheless useful to learn
of the specifics of what I mean by an addictive accommodationism. In his pursuit of
movements, his overall pattern was diligently to learn from them, to throw himself into them,
and then eventually to baptize them insofar as they showed any remote kinship with
Christianity, and then to turn to another movement." Oden was describing his own
experience.
In the desire to make Christian theology an "amiable accommodation to modernity," Oden
found himself involved in many different movements. His list includes the ecumenical
movement, the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement during the Vietnam era, the
pre-NOW women's rights movement, the existentialist movement, the demythologization
movement (writing his doctoral dissertation on its chief theorist), the client-centered therapy
235
movement, the Gestalt therapy movement, the "third force" movement in humanistic
psychology, and the T-Group movement.
Oden concludes sadly, however, tat after long years of being a wandering theologian, "I
now experience the afterburn of 'movement' existence, of messianic pretensions, of
self-congratulatory idealism. . . . The shocker is not merely that I rode so many bandwagons,
but that I thought I was doing Christian teaching a marvelous favor by it and at times
considered this accommodation the very substance of the Christian teaching office. While
Christian teaching must not rule out any investigations of truth or active involvement to
embody it, it should be wary lest it reduce Christian doctrine to these movements, and it
should be better prepared to discern which movements are more or less an expression of
Christ's ministry to the world."
Although he has not yet fully arrived at the destination of sola scriptura (the sole authority
of Scripture), it is to Thomas Oden's credit that after his long years in the far country of
accommodationist theology, like the prodigal son he has finally made the decision to go back
to his father's house.23
Oden's traveler's story upon his return home is instructive for anyone currently wandering
in the far country: "Meanwhile, in the period before the reversal, my intellectual dialogue
remained embarrassingly constricted almost exclusively to university colleagues and liberal
churchmen, the only club I knew. When I later discovered among brilliant Protestant
evangelicals a superb quality of exegesis, I wondered why it took so long."
Oden may have discovered what Bible-believing Christians have always known: "The
honest way to commend God's revealed truth to an unbelieving generation is not to disguise it
as a word of man, and to act as if we could never be sure of it, but had to keep censoring and
amending it at the behest of the latest scholarship, and dared not believe it further than
historical agnosticism gives us leave; but to preach it in a way which shows the world that we
believe it whole-heartedly, and to cry to God to accompany our witness with His Spirit, so
that we too may preach 'in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.' The apologetic strategy
that would attract converts by the flattery of accommodating the gospel to the 'wisdom' of
sinful man was condemned by Paul nineteen centuries ago, and the past hundred years have
provided a fresh demonstration of its bankruptcy. The world may call its compromises
'progressive' and 'enlightened' (those are its names for all forms of thought that pander to its
conceit); those who produce them will doubtless, by a natural piece of wishful thinking, call
them 'bold' and 'courageous,' and perhaps 'realistic' and 'wholesome'; but the Bible condemns
them as sterile aberrations. And the Church cannot hope to recover its power till it resolves to
turn its back on them."24
Regrettably, not a few of Adventist scholars and leaders are still halting between two
opinions, the worldview of classical liberalism and that of biblical Christianity.25 Is it any
wonder that in certain quarters of the Adventist church the call to "come out of Babylon" is
growing faint? Where are today's Daniels and Nehemiahs?
One of them was in a university of modern Babylon. When this Bible-believing Adventist
scholar dared to stand, his courage brought about a change in the way scholars look at the
Bible. His testimony, which will follow, should encourage believers within mainstream
Adventism to continue being faithful. Against the "critical voices" of radical liberalism and
the "confusing voices" of accommodationism/moderate liberalism, they should remain the
"cautious voices within."
Bible-believing Conservatism: The Cautious Voices Within
Bible-believing Christians within the mainstream Seventh-day Adventist church maintain
236
that since the Bible is the Word of God, it is absolutely dependable or trustworthy in all of its
assertions regarding religious doctrine as well as its incidental statements on science,
geography and history. Consequently, they do not pick and choose from the Bible nor make a
dichotomy between sections of the Bible that are factual and those that are not. But they do
recognize that there are difficulties in the Bible which they must contend with as they
"wrestle with the Word" daily.
Whereas liberals and accommodationists treat Bible difficulties as inaccuracies,
contradictions, or even errors, Bible-believing Christians, relying on the Holy Spirit, study
prayerfully and humbly those things in the Bible that are "hard to be understood." These
conservatives suggest that there is a better way of dealing with Bible difficulties without
compromising the integrity of Scriptures. The next testimony shows that when Christians are
"rightly dividing the Word," God sometimes intervenes to enlighten them.
Testimony of a Bible-Believing Conservative Scholar
The attitude of Bible-believing students towards unresolved difficulties is not only biblical,
it is the only way to avoid the kind of pick-and-choose approach that characterizes liberal
theology in both its classical and moderate forms. The work of the late Seventh-day Adventist
scholar, Dr. Edwin R. Thiele, clarifies this point.
But let me first ask you: Have you ever seriously paid attention to details such as this,
"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the
son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. Twenty and five years old was he when he began to
reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. . . . And it came to pass in the
fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. And at the
end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of
Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken" (2 Kings 18:1-2, 9-10)?
Have you tried figuring out how to fit together the regnal (ruling) years of the kings of
Israel and those of the kings in Judah in the above passage?
For the casual reader of Scripture, phrases such as "Now in the eighteenth year of king
Jeroboam" (1 Kings 15:1) pose no problem and usually attract little notice. To biblical
scholars of a few years ago, however, the chronologies of the Hebrew kings did not add up
correctly. Baffled by the apparent discrepancies, Edwin R. Thiele set out to unravel the
mystery. He described his successful breakthrough in this way:
"'It cannot be done. If the numbers had been correct to begin with, it might have been
possible to accomplish in straightening out Hebrew chronology, but the numbers of the kings
were not correctly recorded at the beginning, so there is nothing that we can do with them
today.'
"The voice was that of my teacher, W. A. Irwin, chairman of the Department of Old
Testament at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, as he rejected my request to make
the chronology of the Hebrew kings the subject of my Master's thesis. In beginning his class
discussion of the books of Kings, Professor Irwin had called attention to the constant
contradictions and errors in the regnal data. At the close of the class I had spoken to him
about the need for something to be done about the problems he had mentioned, which led to
my request for this to be the subject for my Master's thesis.
"So I chose another subject. When my Master's work was over and I was beginning work
on my doctorate I went again to Professor Irwin to request that the chronology of the Hebrew
rulers be the subject of my doctoral dissertation. Again he refused, saying that it was entirely
impossible to bring any sort of order to the chaotic state of the chronology of the Hebrew
237
rulers.
"When I spoke to him, Professor George Cameron, my cuneiform teacher, was of the same
mind as Professor Irwin. And when I approached Prof. A. T. Olmstead, the renowned
Assyriologist and Hebrew scholar, he said that for more tha 2,000 years the most able Biblical
scholars had been wrestling with this problem and had accomplished nothing. If they could do
nothing, neither could I. He added that he himself had been working on the chronology of the
Hebrew rulers all his life, without success. There was no use for me to make an attempt.
"But I could not bring myself to believe that the Biblical numbers about the Hebrew rulers
were a mass of errors. I believed the difficulty was that those who had been working on the
problem did not understand the original chronological methods employed by the early
recorders. If these could be brought to light, order would replace the seeming chaos. The
subject fascinated me, so I gave it a great deal of attention. In time the major difficulties were
resolved. I found the Biblical statements beginning to harmonize."26
Thiele's painstaking study resolved the problem of the chronology of the Hebrew kings
when he took into account three factors the scholars had missed: (a) the coregency of some
kings--i.e., in some instances, two kings (e.g., father and son) might be reigning at the same
time; (b) the accession year and non-accession year methods of chronological reckoning of
regnal years--i.e. there were different calendars used by Israel and Judah when they computed
the regnal years of their kings (just as we have different starting points for calendar years,
academic years, and tax years); and (c) the month of the year when a ruler began his regnal
year--i.e., depending on which calendar one uses, a particular month can mean a different
"year" (e.g., January 1 may refer to a different year depending on whether we are reckoning
calendar, academic or tax years).
Thiele's dissertation resulted in the book The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings,
which the University of Chicago Press published in 1951. Professor Irwin himself provided
fitting testimony to the soundness of the Bible-believer's attitude toward Bible difficulties.
The following are some excerpts from his introduction to Thiele's book:
"The unique feature of Professor Thiele's work is that he has . . . shown that the seeming
inconsistencies and mathematical contradictions no more than hinted at above, really are
nothing of the sort, but integral elements in a sound and accurate chronological system. . . .
The validity of his own findings rests on the simple fact that they work! They take account of
all the data provided by the Biblical record, and organize them in a system that is rational,
consistent, and precise, and coheres likewise with all that is known of relevant chronology of
the entire world of the Bible. . . . He has taken passages commonly regarded as patent
disclosures of carelessness, if not of ignorance, on the part of the Hebrew historians, and has
shown them to be astonishingly reliable. We have, it is true, come some distance from the
radical criticism of half a century ago. In treatment of the text and in appraisal of the historic
reliability of the records we are in a much more cautious mood, as we have seen at one
uncertain point after another our skepticism dissipate under new-found facts. . . . And it is a
matter of first-rate importance to learn now that the Books of Kings are reliable in precisely
that feature which formerly excited only derision. . . . In a brief statement, then, Professor
Thiele's work contributes very significantly both to our respect for the accuracy of the
Hebrew historians and to a growing confidence in the soundness of the long process through
which generation after generation of scribes handed on the sacred text to succeeding ages. . . .
Professor Thiele has made an important contribution to our common quest of truth."27
The above statement comes from a scholar who once questioned the accuracy of the
Bible's numbers. How encouraging it is to know that the numbers of the Hebrew kings, once
regarded as wrong, are actually right and give mathematical support to the historical
soundness of the accounts of the Hebrew rulers recorded in the Word of God.
238
But this was possible only because an obscure Bible-believing student, like David meeting
Goliath, could not bring himself to believe 2,000 years of scholarly consensus held by his
theology professors--the view that the Bible's numbers about the Hebrew rulers were a mass
of errors.
And this renowned scholar was a Seventh-day Adventist in a liberal institution!
Dr. Thiele's example suggests to today's Bible-believing Adventists that whenever they are
confronted with what may appear to be mistakes in the Bible, they should suspend judgment
on the problem as they patiently seek to discover an underlying harmony. Ellen G. White
stated it this way: "As several [Bible] writers present a subject under varied aspects and
relations, there may appear, to the superficial, careless, or prejudiced reader, to be
discrepancy or contradiction, where the thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer insight,
discerns the underlying harmony (The Great Controversy, p. vi, emphasis supplied).
The Challenge We Face. But daring to be a Daniel, sometimes even in Israel, is not
always easy. In many instances, one is misunderstood, misrepresented, and viciously
attacked, even by one's friends. Because it is unpopular for anyone today to uphold the Word,
and because doing so can result in the loss of recognition, position, and employment, only a
few are willing to be "faithful unto the end."
Entrenched liberalism within Bible-believing churches has encouraged the academic
community (professors of religion and theology, editors, publishers and institutional heads)
flagrantly to disregard established Bible truths. Regrettably, there appears to be a reluctance
among church leaders (pastors and administrators, whether elected or appointed) to deal
courageously with the heresies of historical-critical theology.28 But should this be so?
The apostle Paul charges Christians "before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in
season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine" (2 Tim
4:1-2). As we conclude Receiving the Word, we shall illustrate what, in practical terms, is
entailed by this solemn charge. We shall explore the implications of a Seventh-day
Adventist's commitment to living by the Word.

difference between today's feminist ministries and the women's ministries of the early
Adventist pioneers: "Today, feminist ministries contrast sharply with the Women's Ministry
back then [in the days of the pioneers]. Whereas the spirituality of the Adventist sisters was
the greatest burden of the first movement, it seems to be assumed in the second; whereas
soul-winning was the whole purpose of the first, it does not always seem to be foremost in the
second; whereas the first movement stressed the worth and influence of a woman on the
domestic scene in the home, such a concept seems nigh-repulsive to many in the second
movement; whereas power was equated with the Holy Spirit in the first, one almost senses
that it is equated with position in the second" (Laurel Damsteegt, "Shall Women Minister?"

15. The distinctive features of theological liberalism have been summarized as follows:
(1) an adaptation of the essentials of Christian faith to current naturalistic and anthropocentric
views; (2) a skeptical view of historic Christian supernaturalism and miracles; (3) a view of
the Bible as a fallible human record of the religious thought and experience of people who
lived in Bible times, rather than viewing Scriptures as a true divine revelation of God's will;
(4) an immanent or pantheistic, sub-Trinitarian idea of God as working chiefly through
culture, a denial of Jesus Christ's incarnation and Deity, and an optimistic evolutionary
worldview; (5) a confident view of humanity's power to perceive God by reflecting on
experience, and thus, the belief that human beings can do true theology without making the
Bible the sole authority for knowledge; (6) a denial of the fall, human sinfulness, penal
substitutionary atonement, a need for God's sovereign grace in conversion, and a personal
second coming of Christ and the establishment of His kingdom. See James I. Packer,

Chapter Twelve
Living By the Word
We have come to the final chapter of Receiving the Word. As we explained in "To the
Reader," this book was written with the following specific objectives: (1) to create an
awareness among Bible-believing Adventists--whether laymembers, students, or leaders--of
the nature and implications of liberalism's approach to Scripture so that they may be prepared
to respond to it effectively; (2) to offer some answers to our young people--including students
of religion and theology--who, because of doubts and skepticism created by some of their
pastors and Bible teachers, are confused about important issues regarding the authority and
interpretation of the Scriptures; and (3) to invite the convinced and crusading advocates of the
contemporary liberal methodologies to reconsider their assumptions and attitudes toward the
Word.
We have attempted to explain how the loss of Adventist identity and mission in some parts
of the world is related to an erosion of confidence in the Bible as God's inspired, trustworthy
Word, the church's sole norm of authority for doctrine and practice. By highlighting the crisis
over the Word we have identified the doubts over the Word, quarrels over the Word,
departures from the Word, and attempts to liberate the Word as symptoms of the cracks in our
theological foundation.
We have also shown that these cracks arise from the use of contemporary liberalism's
higher criticism. By calling upon readers to make a commitment to be found trusting the
Word, contending for the Word, upholding the Word, rightly dividing the Word, wrestling
with the Word, and testifying about the Word, we have urged Bible-believing Adventists to
receive, respect and relay the message of God's inspired, trustworthy, and authoritative Word.
Given the issues raised in this book and their implications for the faith and practice of
Seventh-day Adventists, it is appropriate that we conclude by addressing one final question:
"How should we then live?" (Eze 33:10).
Living by the Word. Jesus Christ Himself provided the response to the above question: "It
is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God" (Matt 4:4). In this first recorded message of Christ after His baptism, Jesus
bids His followers imitate His example of living by the Word. The importance, urgency, and
challenge of living by the Word will be the focus of this chapter.
The Importance of Living by the Word
More than two centuries ago, in 1742, a noted scholar stated how the health of the church
depends on its feeding on Scripture: "Scripture is the foundation of the Church: the Church is
the guardian of Scripture. When the Church is in strong health, the light of Scripture shines
bright; when the Church is sick, Scripture is corroded by neglect; and thus it happens, that the
outward form of Scripture and that of the Church, usually seem to exhibit simultaneously
either health or else sickness; and as a rule the way in which Scripture is being treated is in
exact correspondence with the condition of the Church."1
Theological and Biblical Malnutrition. Reflecting upon the relevance of the above
statement to our contemporary situation, a well-respected Evangelical scholar wrote: "It is no
242
secret that Christ's Church is not at all in good health in many places of the world. She has
been languishing because she has been fed, as the current line has it, 'junk food'; all kinds of
artificial preservatives and all sorts of unnatural substitutes have been served up to her. As a
result, theological and Biblical malnutrition has afflicted the very generation that has taken
such giant steps to make sure its physical health is not damaged by using foods or products
that are carcinogenic or otherwise harmful to their physical bodies. Simultaneously a
worldwide spiritual famine resulting from the absence of any genuine publication of the Word
of God (Amos 8:11) continues to run wild and almost unabated in most quarters of the
Church."2
Cries for the Word. This diagnosis of the Christian church at large can apply to
contemporary Seventh-day Adventism. Ellen White's description of the situation in Protestant
churches of her day can summarize what obtains in some parts of our own church today:
"The Bible has been robbed of its power, and the results are seen in a lowering of the tone
of spiritual life. In the sermons from many pulpits of today there is not that divine
manifestation which awakens the conscience and brings life to the soul. The hearers can not
say, 'Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked with us by the way, and while He
opened to us the Scriptures?' Luke 24:32. There are many who are crying out for the living
God, longing for the divine presence. Philosophical theories or literary essays, however
brilliant, cannot satisfy the heart. The assertions and inventions of men are of no value. Let
the word of God speak to the people. Let those who have heard only traditions and human
theories and maxims hear the voice of Him whose word can renew the soul unto everlasting
life" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 40).
Jesus prescribed a cure for this spiritual malady: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matt 4:4). Heeding His counsel will
not only satisfy our spiritual hunger but will also help to prevent the kind of famine for the
Word that the prophet Amos predicted: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I
will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the
words of the Lord: And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east,
they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it" (Amos 8:11-12).
The Urgency of Living by the Word
Living by the Word is the only means by which we can face Satan's end-time deceptions.
As we noted in Chapter One, mainstream Adventism is caught in a crossfire of attacks from
the liberal left, which operates within the church structure, and th independent right, which
often operates from without by establishing organizations and structures of their own.
Applying to our situation Ellen G. White's statement that "we have far more to fear from
within than from without" (Selected Messages, 1:122), we explained why this book
concentrates on the theological views of entrenched liberalism.3
Indeed, in Chapters Five and Six we showed how sophisticated departing from the Word
could represent Satan's end-time attempt to employ intellectual philosophy to undermine the
established doctrines of our faith. Such a situation highlights the urgent need for living by the
Word.
During Jesus' temptations in the wilderness, the enemy confronted Him with subtle
reinterpretations of God's Word, calculated to generate doubts and to deceive. Four thousand
years earlier, mother Eve faced the same kind of philosophical speculation on the Word of
God when Satan appeared to her in the Garden of Eden. Instead of living by the Word, she
chose to dally with the enemy's suggestions. In the end, her God-given human mind proved
243
no match for the mind of this fallen angel.
But it was not so with Jesus Christ. When confronted with Satan's intellectual philosophy,
He refused to yield to the subtle temptation to employ the enemy's higher critical method
"without adopting its naturalistic presuppositions."4 Instead, He pointed to the plain reading
of Scripture: "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matt 4:4). In this assertion, our Savior prescribed for us
the only effective response to the enemy's well-planned strategy to deceive.
In Chapter Five, Part VI, we promised to explore more fully the implications of a
significant statement by Ellen G. White. We shall do so here, starting with a review of the
statement itself. A closer examination of the enemy's end-time strategy will help us to
understand the urgency of living by the Word.
End-Time Deception. In the wake of the Kellogg crisis in the early 1900s, Ellen White
recorded this insightful scenario of Satan's intentions for the church.5
"The enemy of souls has sought to bring in the supposition that a great reformation was to
take place among Seventh-day Adventists, and that this reformation would consist in giving
up the doctrines which stand as the pillars of our faith, and engaging in a process of
reorganization. Were this reformation to take place, what would result? The principles of truth
that God in His wisdom has given to the remnant church, would be discarded. Our religion
would be changed. The fundamental principles that have sustained the work for the last fifty
years would be accounted as error. A new organization would be established. Books of a new
order would be written. A system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced. The
founders of this system would go into the cities, and do a wonderful work. The Sabbath of
course, would be lightly regarded, as also the God who created it. Nothing would be allowed
to stand in the way of the new movement. The leaders would teach that virtue is better than
vice, but God being removed, they would place their dependence on human power, which,
without God, is worthless. Their foundation would be built on the sand, and storm and
tempest would sweep away the structure" (Selected Messages, 1:204, 205).
A summary of this end-time deception's essential characteristics will reveal whether it has
anything to say about constructing "Adventism for a new generation" along the lines of
modern liberal scholarship.6
1. The Motivation. It would come about as some seek to "reform" the church, probably not
fully aware that Satan is behind this "great reformation." Could some of the present day
efforts to make the church "more relevant to this generation" be playing into the hands of the
enemy of souls?
2. The Nature. The so-called reform would consist in giving up the doctrines of our faith
and pursuing a reorganization. Is this what we are witnessing today as our distinctive
doctrines are being abandoned for theologies of "love" "compassion" and "acceptance"? We
have seen attcks on our worldwide church government, persistent calls for "rebellion,"
prominent people advocating congregationalism, and power consolidating into a few hands.
Are these indications of anything?
3. The Results. Among the results of this deception are the following:
(i) The distinctive doctrines that have identified us as a remnant church would be
discarded. Does this include the distinctive S's: (a) Scripture's inspiration, trustworthiness,
and sole authority, (b) the Substitutionary atonement of Christ, (c) Salvation by grace alone
through faith in Jesus Christ; (d) the Sanctuary message, (e) the Second-coming of Christ, (f)
the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, (g) the State of the dead, (h) the Spirit of Prophecy,
(i) Stewardship, and (j) Standards regarding food, drink, dress, entertainment, relationships,
etc.?
244
(ii) Our religion would be changed. Does it mean that while retaining the name
"Seventh-day Adventist" to describe ourselves and our churches and institutions, our faith
would not be recognizable to our pioneers? Is a mutation or metamorphosis being suggested
here?
(iii) The fundamental principles that have sustained us in the past would be considered
defective--i.e., accounted as error. In addition to those already listed above as distinctive
doctrines, do these fundamental principles also include principles of interpretation--the plain
reading of Scripture, which "new generation" scholars despise as "literal," "rigid," and a
"proof-text" method?
(iv) A new organization would be established. Does this include the patterning of our
administrative structure and leadership style along the lines of corporate business or political
organizations? Does it say anything about the subtle but persistent campaigns for "women
elders"? Is this also an allusion to some of the ecumenical alliances being proposed? Does it
include, perhaps, new liturgical structures, such as worship styles with charismatic
undertones, including the so-called "celebration churches," and interest in
"power-encounters," "deliverance ministries," and speaking in unintelligible ecstatic
"tongues"?
(v) Books of new order would be written. Does this include the flurry of books, articles,
audio and video productions, etc., being published, promoted, and distributed by our
publishing houses, Adventist publications and book centers, though they undermine faith in
our biblical doctrines and practices? Can it refer to the subtle dissemination of such ideas in
our homes, classrooms, pulpits, and at committee meetings? Does it include the attempts by
some to challenge, distort, or revise our Adventist history to accommodate today's ideological
agendas?
(vi) A system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced. Is this a reference to the
departure from the plain reading of the Bible, reinterpreting it along the lines suggested by
speculative philosophies--science, tradition, sociology, psychology, etc.? Is it a warning
against the prostitution of human rationality into rationalism? Does it say anything about the
so-called "matured," "enlightened," "progressive," "principle," "historic," "dynamic,"
"casebook," "sophisticated," and "abstract" thinking of our day?
(vii) A wonderful work would be conducted in the cities, in which the Sabbath and the God
of the Sabbath are lightly regarded. Is this a reference to humanistic humanitarian works in
our cities and communities? Does this also involve an alliance with the charismatic
movement, in which "prayer warriors" join hands to offer "intercessory prayer" to "bind and
exorcise the demons and wicked spirits that are tormenting our cities and communities"? Is
the reference to the Sabbath being lightly regarded a suggestion that some will make
concessions in an attempt to make the Sabbath more "relevant and meaningful" both to the
world and to church members? Does this include carelessness regarding Sabbath observance,
and perhaps a general lowering of all Adventist standards?
(viii) Nothing would be allowed to stand in the way of the new movement. Could this
statement be a hint regarding the stubborn, determined, and adamant spirit of the leaders of
this new movement who, in the language of today, will "use any means necessary," fair or
foul, to pursue their ideological objectives? Are the "tithe embargoes," the "strategy sessions,"
and "rebellion" of some congregations symptoms of this new movement?
(ix) While teaching that virtue is better than vice, God is removed and they depend on
human power. Is this an allusion to a claim to have enlightened views on ethical morality
(abortion, women's ordination, homosexuality, pre- and extra-marital sex, divorce and
remarriage, race relations, etc.) and ethical values ("love," "justice," "compassion,"
"kindness," "equality," "acceptance," "fairness," etc.), while actually following a humanistic
245
ethical system, from which "God is removed"? Does the suggestion of "dependence on human
power" indicate a theology of self-reliance, one which repudiates the substitutionary
atonement of Christ, and salvation (both justification and sanctification) by faith alone?
(x) The theological house built on a foundation of sand would be swept away. Is this the
clearest indication that any theological house--however impressive it may look on the inside
and outside (the curtains, carpets, painting, electronic gadgets, etc.) and however talented the
architects may be--will be swept away by the impending storms if it fails to build on the solid
foundations of Bible?7 Could this then suggest that, instead of going along with this new
movement which is building its modern towers of Babel, we must rather dig deep, building on
Christ the solid Rock--which requires living by the Word?
The Enemy's End-Time Strategy. Notice that it was Satan who master-minded
liberalism's skepticism toward the Word so that God's people would be uncertain of their true
identity as God's end-time remnant and their true mission of proclaiming the three angels'
messages and preparing a people for Christ's second coming. This loss of identity and mission
in some parts of the church is resulting in a paralysis and death of the churches and
institutions that have come under the sway of historical-critical theology. Then, in another
deceptive attempt to "revive" the churches that he has helped to kill, the enemy is suggesting
a "reformation" along the lines of the charismatic movement's "new ecumenism."
What the talented architects of "Adventism for a New Generation" overlook is that they are
building their theological house on shifting sand. Unless they build on the solid Rock--Christ,
the incarnate Word, and the Bible, the written Word--theirs will be like the house in Jesus'
parable: "The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that
house, and it fell with a great crash" (Matt 7:27 NIV).
Doesn't this prospect of an end-time deception demand that we clearly understand what
living by the Word entails?
The Challenge of Living by the Word
Through the sacred pages of Scripture, Seventh-day Adventists have found their identity as
the remnant church (Rev 12:17; 14:12) and their prophetic mandate to proclaim "the
everlasting gospel" (Rev 14:6). In this Book they have discovered the will and eternal
character of God and His ethical demands upon the believers who claim to be His special
end-time people. As "bread" or "food" (Matt 4:4; Job 23:12), the inspired Word has fed us
and provided nourishment for our spiritual growth. Today, however, we are afflicted with
"theological and biblical malnutrition." In order to recover from our present ailing condition,
we must be willing to take the following steps:
1. We Must Receive the Word. There was a time when Adventists were known as the
"People of the Book," even "Bookworms"! In our day, however, we have become
"tapeworms," chasing the latest audio and video tapes from our self-appointed authorities, be
they pastors, professors of theology and science, psychologists, parents, or personal
acquaintances. But we are to receive the Word, "not as the word of men, but as it is in truth,
the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you who believe" (1 Thess 2:13).
This means that rather than holding up human traditions, opinion polls, subjective
experience, the pronouncements of learned men, and the latest research findings in
naturalistic science and secular psychology as alternative sources of dependable knowledge,
we must always insist upon the Bible and the Bible only as the rule of faith and lifestyle (see
The Great Controversy, p. 595).
246
2. We Must Feed on the Word. "As we feed on the Word of the Lord we are feasting on
the Lord of the Word, and in receiving life from His Word, we are receiving His very life"8
(cf. John 6:32-63). "What food is to the body, Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot benefit
us unless we eat it, unless it becomes a part of our being. . . . A theoretical knowledge will do
us no good. We must feed upon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that His life becomes our
life" (The Desire of Ages, p. 389). "He who by faith receives the Word is receiving the very
life and character of God" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 38).
Feeding on the Word can make even little children grow "wise unto salvation" (2 Tim
3:15). Therefore, we are not to "think that the Bible will become a tiresome book to the
children. Under a wise instructor the work [of educating the young in truths of the Word] will
become more and more desirable. It will be to them as the bread of life, and will never grow
old. There is in it a freshness and beauty that attract and charm the children and youth. It is
like the sun shining upon the earth, giving its brightness and warmth, yet never exhausted. By
lessons from the Bible history and doctrine, the children and youth can learn that all other
books are inferior to this. They can find here a fountain of mercy and of love" (Ye Shall
Receive Power, p. 141).
3. We Must Delight in the Word. This is by reading, studying, hearing and meditating
upon the Scriptures (cf. Ps 119:24, 77, 92, 143, 174). It is not enough merely to read the
Bible; we must enjoy it and testify about it. Jeremiah said: "Thy words were found, and I did
eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart" (Jer 15:16). David
testified: "How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!"
(Ps 119:103; cf. 19:10). Such has been the experience of God's people throughout the
centuries.
However, "the joy of Bible study is not the fun of collecting esoteric tidbits about Gog and
Magog, Tubal-cain and Methuselah, Bible numerics and the beast, and so on; nor is it the
pleasure, intense for the tidy-minded, of analyzing our translated text into preachers' pretty
patterns, with neatly numbered headings held together by apt alliteration's artful aid. Rather, it
is the deep contentment that comes of communing with the living Lord into whose presence
the Bible takes us--a joy which only His own true disciples know."9
Or as Ellen G. White put it, "The word of the living God is not merely written, but spoken.
The Bible is God's voice speaking to us, just as surely as though we could hear it with our
ears. If we realized this, with what awe would we open God's word, and with what
earnestness would we search its precepts! The reading and contemplation of the Scriptures
would be regarded as an audience with the Infinite One" (Testimonies for the Church, 6:393).
4. We Must Heed the Word. In Christ's parable of the two builders (Matt 7:24-27), what
distinguished the wise man from the foolish man was the fact that the wise man not only
heard the Word, he also heeded its message. We must receive the Word as the "word of the
living God, the word that is our life, the word that is to mold our actions, our words, and our
thoughts. To hold God' word as anything less than this is to reject it" (Education, p. 260,
emphasis supplied). In the words of an old hymn, we must let "our words be echoed by our
ways" (cf. 1 Pet 3:1; James 1:22-24).
5. We Must be Guided by the Word. In addition to having our individual lives regulated
by the Word, the church, as a corporate body of believers, must also be guided by the Word in
every facet of its life. A commitment to be so guided will demand the following:10
(i) Instead of making personal and corporate decisions on a pragmatic basis, subjective
247
experience, or majority vote, church members and committees will seek God's will by
seriously searching the Scriptures.
(ii) Rather than allowing pluralistic theology and financial profit to drive our publishing
houses, publications, and book centers, we shall publish and distribute books, periodicals,
articles, and editorials that are Bible-centered in content and unifying in effect.
(iii) Instead of allowing the winds of secularism to deflect our schools away from the
standards and objectives established by our pioneers, our educational institutions and school
boards will maintain a steady direction by hiring and retaining only teachers and workers
whose teachings and influence bolster confidence in our fundamental beliefs and lifestyle.
(iv) Rather than encouraging our medical institutions and offices to do "what seemeth right
in their own eyes," we shall allow the Bible to inform our Adventist philosophy and practice
of health and healing.
(v) Instead of permitting sociology (the church growth movement), psychology (the
self-esteem movement), politics (both the Christian Left and Right), business (profit and
marketing techniques), Hollywood (the entertainment industry), and power-encounters (the
signs and wonders movement) to determine our methods of evangelism, our style of worship,
and the content of our sermons, pastors, evangelists, and those engaged in pastoral work will
provide biblical messages based on the great themes and truths of Adventism.
(vi) Rather than neglecting the Bible for the views of our self-appointed "thought-leaders"
or employing the Bible to support pet ideas or to display individual talent, elders, Sabbath
school teachers and musicians will ground their teaching and music solidly in the Word of
God.
(vii) Instead of becoming astute politicians and business executives, church leaders will be
more spiritually oriented, steeping their minds in the principles of Scripture; our pioneers
were not merely church administrators, they were also competent Bible theologians with a
single-minded commitment to the truths of God's Word and Christian piety.
(viii) Rather than allowing today's anti-Christian higher criticism which dominates the
academic community--in professional societies, meetings, scholarly publications, and
recognition--to determine the standards of our scholarship, theologians and Bible teachers
will pursue the highest level of academic excellence that will not surrender the truth; they will
also not wait until retirement to honor their theological convictions.
(ix) Instead of selling their souls at the price of academic grades, degrees,
recommendations, accolades, and recognition, religion and theology students will seek an
education from Jesus Christ, the Master Teacher. For "in the presence of such a Teacher, of
such opportunity for divine education, what worse than folly is it to seek an education apart
from Him--to seek to be wise apart from Wisdom; to be true while rejecting Truth; to seek
illumination apart from the Light, and existence without the Life; to turn from the Fountain of
living waters, and hew out broken cisterns, that can hold no water" (Education, p. 83).
(x) And rather than being gullible regarding the counterfeit elements of faith and lifestyle
being disseminated in our classrooms, publications, and churches, young people, especially
students in the secondary schools (academies), colleges, and universities, will demand from
their teachers, editors, youth pastors, and leaders a pain "Thus saith the Lord" before
accepting any new views. In the language of Ellen G. White, "My message to you is: No
longer consent to listen without protest to the perversion of truth. . . . God calls upon men and
women to take their stand under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel. I have been
instructed to warn our people; for many are in danger of receiving theories and sophistries
that undermine the foundation pillars of the faith" (Selected Messages, 1:196-197).
6. We Must Have the Courage to Stand for the Word. Our individual spiritual lives
248
depend on the inspired Word. Our identity and mission as a church depend upon it.
Consequently, we must not adopt postures of theological neutrality when God's truth and
honor are being jeopardized. With the prospect of an end-time deception before us, we shall
not be afraid to stand up for the truth--even if we have to lose our privileges, opportunities,
positions, sources of livelihood, cherished relationships, yes, even our own lives (see Luke
14:26, 27, 33).
Such is the case in the current crisis over biblical inspiration and interpretation. The
on-going quarrel over the Word is not the kind of theological hairsplitting among scholars
that can be overcome by mere "tolerance," "love," "understanding," or celebrating "diversity"
of ideas. What is really at issue is the futile attempt to make error cohabit with truth. And
what is at stake is salvation; for the choice is between the false doctrines of men and the truth
as it is in Jesus Christ.
Let's be clear on this: No matter how the crisis is disguised, there are only two real choices
confronting Bible-believing Adventists. The choice is not between scholarly enlightenment
and narrow-minded obscurantism, as some have suggested regarding the "abstract thinking"
of the so-called "principle approach" versus the "infantile and immature thinking" of the
so-called "literal approach."11 Rather, in the debate over liberalism's higher criticism, the
believer is faced with a choice between two versions of Seventh-day Adventism.
Even here, the choice is not between Adventism that is patterned after "the church of the
West" and an Adventism that is modeled after "the rest of the church." It is a choice between
an Adventism consistent with biblical Christianity and a counterfeit fashioned according to
the spirit of our age; between an Adventism resting its faith wholly upon the solid foundation
of God's revealed Word and another building on the shifting sand of human opinion.
We have to choose whether to bow to the authority of Jesus Christ as revealed in His
inspired Word or whether, on our own authority, to discount and disregard some parts of His
Word.
We have to decide whether to submit our thoughts to be transformed by His Word or to
cherish the intellectual arrogance that refuses to be enlightened by the Word.
We have to choose whether to be deluded by sophisticated Laodiceanism, which flatters
itself that "I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing," or whether to be
enlightened by "the Amen, the faithful and true witness," who pleads in His inspired Word, "I
counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,
that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint
thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see" (Rev 3:14-22).
In short, we face the same choice that confronted Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden:
Shall we trust God and obey His inspired Word, or, in our desire to obtain Satan's
"open-mindedness," shall we distrust God and disobey His revealed Word? This is the
ultimate choice that faces us in this end-time crisis over the Word.
Bible-believing Adventists need, therefore, to understand clearly that the cracks in the
theological foundation of our faith--the skepticism about the sole authority and
trustworthiness of Scripture--are the most serious threat that our church has ever faced. This
is why the present crisis over biblical authority and interpretation cannot be lightly dismissed
as non-existent, ignored by "administrative ostrich-ism," or camouflaged either by
rearranging the theologcal furniture or by installing modern theological gadgets.12
"Light and darkness cannot harmonize. Between truth and error there is an irrepressible
conflict. To uphold and defend the one is to attack and overthrow the other" (The Great
Controversy, p. 126).
Once we understand what is at stake and have made a commitment to stand for the Word,
we must be willing to employ our God-given voices, pens, and votes to speak out boldly and
249
clearly against any attempt to make the Bible captive to the spirit of our age, whether in
pulpit, classroom, publication, or church council meeting.
Ellen G. White summed up what standing for the Word entails: "Now is the time for God's
people to show themselves true to principle. When the religion of Christ is most held in
contempt, when His law is most despised, then should our zeal be the warmest and our
courage and firmness the most unflinching. To stand in defense of truth and righteousness
when the majority forsake us, to fight the battles of the Lord when champions are few--this
will be our test. At this time we must gather warmth from the coldness of others, courage
from their cowardice, and loyalty from their treason" (Testimonies for the Church, 5:136).
A Final Appeal to Live by the Word
The 1995 General Conference session at Utrecht, the Netherlands, may be remembered for
highlighting the hermeneutical crisis in the contemporary Seventh-day Adventist church. But
there is another important General Conference session--the last session Ellen White ever
attended--that Adventists should remember. One dramatic act at this gathering may provide
today's church with a way out of its hermeneutical dilemma.13
The 1909 General Conference Session. The session took place in Takoma Park,
Washington, D.C., in 1909. This was not the first time Mrs. White had attended such an
assembly of believers. She had been at the first general gathering of Sabbath-keeping
Adventists in 1848 and succeeding Sabbatarian conferences.14 She had been present with the
brethren as they diligently studied the Word and established the doctrinal structure of the
church on that Word. Ellen White had also attended almost all of the General Conference
sessions from 1863 on, when she was not away in Europe and Australia.
But the 1909 session was special. Delegates from various parts of the world brought
detailed and thrilling reports. In her lifetime Ellen White had seen the church grow from a
handful of Sabbath-keeping Adventists in New England in 1846 to 83,000 at the close of
1908. Of the total, 59,000 lived in the United States and 24,000 in other parts of the world.
The 1908 Statistical Report recorded in the 1909 General Conference Bulletin indicates that
the total tithe paid into the treasuries of the church in 1908 had grown to $1.1 million. There
were nearly 800 ordained ministers and 400 more who held ministerial licenses.
Indeed, the Lord had blessed the labors of the group of believers who saw themselves as
the "remnant church," a special people with a special message for a special time.
During the three-and-a-half weeks of the 1909 session, Ellen White met with her brethren
from the world field as they discussed plans for global evangelism. She used every speaking
opportunity given her to admonish, encourage, and instruct the delegates. While she spoke on
health reform and health interests, the principal theme in her messages was evangelistic
outreach, with emphasis on both personal and city evangelism.
As the session drew to a close, Mrs. White felt impressed that she would never attend
another Generl Conference session; and she never did. What would be her final message to
the world assembly?
A Touching Farewell. It was the last day of the session, Sunday afternoon, June 6.
Around 3:00 p.m. the delegates were gathered to listen to her speak on the theme, "Partakers
of the Divine Nature." Rather than presenting a well-crafted sermon, she simply read the
Word, occasionally interspersing a few comments of her own. The Bible texts she read were
the entire first chapter of 2 Peter and the first and fourth chapters of 1 Peter--passages that
speak about the privileges of the Christian. The General Conference Bulletin summarized the
250
thrust of her final message under the title, "A Touching Farewell":
"As the aged speaker referred to her appreciation of the privileges of the General
Conference session, and expressed her intense anxiety that the meeting might result in great
good to all in attendance, the congregation responded with many hearty 'amens.' And, with
trembling lips and a voice touched with deep emotion, she assured the ministers and other
workers that God loves them, and Jesus delights to make intercession in their behalf.
"The speaker exhorted every worker to go forth in the strength of the Mighty One of Israel.
She declared that while she might never have the privilege of meeting her brethren from
abroad in another Conference like this one, yet she would pray for them, and prepare to meet
them all in the kingdom of glory."
She then closed her address with these words: "Brethren, we shall separate for a little
while, but let us not forget what we have heard at this meeting. Let us go forward in the
strength of the Mighty One, considering the joy that is set before us of seeing His face in the
kingdom of God and of going out no more forever. Let us remember that we are to be
partakers of the divine nature, and that angels of God are right around us, that we need not be
overcome by sin. Let us send our petitions to the throne of God in time of temptation, and in
faith lay hold of His divine power. I pray God that this may be the experience of each one of
us, and that in the great day of God we all may be glorified together" (Manuscript 49, 1909).
A Dramatic Act and Final Words. Having thus concluded the last sermon she was to
preach at a General Conference session, the 82-year old messenger of the Lord moved away
from the desk and headed toward her seat. Suddenly she stopped, turned and came back to the
pulpit. Picking up the Bible from which she had earlier read, she opened it, held it out on
extended hands that trembled with age, and said, "Brethren and Sisters, I commend unto you
this Book." Without another word, she closed the Book, and walked from the platform.15
By this dramatic act and these final words, Ellen White reminded the leaders of the church
officially assembled in conference of the vital and preeminent role that the Word of God is to
play in the life and mission of the Seventh-day Adventist church. In her very first book, she
had also written: "I recommend to you, dear reader, the Word of God as the rule of your faith
and practice" (Early Writings, p. 78). Throughout her life and ministry she exalted that Word.
And now, in her last official message to the world body at a General Conference session, she
again commended that Word to the church.
The Challenge Before Us. It is almost ninety years since she thus exalted the inspired
Book before the church. Since that time the Seventh-day Adventist church has experienced all
manner of crises. But it has survived and is still growing, especially in areas of the world
where the members, teachers, pastors, evangelists, and leaders still uphold that Word.
Faithfulness to the inspired Scriptures has been our strength. It has given power to our
preaching and weight to our witness. And in these final days it is our only safeguard against
the delusions of Satan.16
Regrettably, at a time when the clock of human history is about to strike midnight, at a
time when there is urgent need for the Bible to shine brightly as a lamp unto our feet and a
light unto our path (Ps 119:105), attempts are being made to obscure this divine Ligh.
Given this fact, we must ask ourselves: What shall we do with the Book called the Holy
Bible? Shall we receive it as the Word of the living God, or shall we doubt it?
The apostolic church, the church that proclaimed the first advent of Christ, faced this same
question. Scripture testifies in many places concerning them: The believers in Samaria
"received the word of God" (Acts 8:14); the Gentile believers in Caesarea "also received the
word of God" (Acts 11:1); the believers of Berea "received the word with all readiness of
251
mind" (Acts 17:11); and the believers at Thessalonica "received the word in much affliction,
with joy of the Holy Ghost" (1 Thess 1:6; cf. 2:13).
God's end-time church, some two thousand years after the era of the apostles, also faces
the same question. Will the remnant movement that has been divinely commissioned to "lift
up the trumpet and loud let it ring" respond positively? The pioneers of the Seventh-day
Adventist movement did so.17 Will the Adventists of this generation, those who are living at
the threshold of the next millennium, emulate their pioneers by receiving the Word?
How will the church respond?
More importantly, how will you respond to this vital question? How will you answer when
you appear before the Lord and He asks, Did you "receive with meekness the engrafted word,
which is able to save your soul" (James 1:21)?
The Reward of Receiving the Word. As you deliberate upon this critical issue of life, let
me state one more reason why you must respond positively: The inspired Word is the only
book that has power to change your life. This is what the apostle Peter meant when he wrote
that we are "born again . . . by the word of God" (1 Pet 1:23).
In case you are still in doubt, consider this: "There are men who study philosophy,
astronomy, geology, geography, and mathematics; but did you ever hear a man say, 'I was an
outcast, a wretched inebriate, a disgrace to my race, and a nuisance in the world, until I began
to study mathematics, and learned the multiplication table, and then turned my attention to
geology, got me a little hammer, and knocked off the corners of the rocks and then studied the
formation of the earth, and since that time I have been happy as the day is long; I feel like
singing all the time; my soul is full of triumph and peace; and health and blessing have come
to my desolate home once more'? Did you ever hear a man ascribe his redemption and
salvation from intemperance and sin and vice to the multiplication table, or the science of
mathematics or geology?
"But I can bring you, not one man, or two, or ten, but men by the thousand who will tell
you, 'I was wretched; I was lost; I broke my poor old mother's heart; I beggared my family;
my wife was heart-stricken and dejected; my children fled from the sound of their father's
footsteps; I was ruined, reckless, helpless, homeless, hopeless, until I heard the words of that
Book'!
"And he will tell you the very word which fastened on his soul. Maybe it was, 'Come unto
Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest;' perhaps it was, 'Behold the
Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world;' it may have been, 'God so loved the
world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not
perish, but have everlasting life.' He can tell you the very word that saved his soul. And since
that word entered his heart, he will tell you that hope has dawned upon his vision, that joy has
inspired his heart, and that his mouth is filled with grateful song. He will tell you that the
blush of health has come back to his poor wife's faded cheek; that the old hats have vanished
from the windows of his desolate home; that his rags have been exchanged for good clothes;
that his children run to meet him when he comes; that there is bread on his table, fire on his
hearth, and comfort in his dwelling. He will tell you all that, and he will tell you that this book
has wrought the change."18
Yes, there is power in the Book, a power that rests on the fact that "all scripture is given by
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works"
(2 Tim 3:16-17).
Given this fact, will you now receive the Word and allow it to change your life? Your
decision should not be based on what you have read in this book or any other works
252
attempting to defend the inspired Word against the skepticism of higher-critical scholarship.
For although in this volume we have sought to challenge liberal thinking in the hope that you
will appreciate more fully how the Bible deserves to be accorded the first and highest
authority in your life and, in so doing, be led to love and experience fellowship with its divine
Author, the irony is that, our endeavor is destined to be ineffective! Why?
Because "what we most need is the book itself. It is its own best witness and defender.
Christians sometimes try to defend the word of God. It seems like half a dozen poodle dogs
trying to defend a lion in his cage. The best thing for us to do is to slip the bars and let the lion
out, and he will defend himself! And the best thing for us to do is to bring out the word of
God, and let 'the sword of the Spirit' prove its own power, as it pierces 'even to the dividing
asunder of soul and spirit' [Eph 6:17; Heb 4:12]."19
Ellen G. White wrote, "The heart that receives the Word of God is not as a pool that
evaporates, not like a broken cistern that loses its treasure. It is like the mountain stream fed
by unfailing springs, whose cool, sparkling waters leap from rock to rock, refreshing the
weary, the thirsty, the heavy laden" (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 130, emphasis supplied).
How Will We Respond? As we stand at the verge of the Promised Land, I encourage you
to join me in receiving the Word with "readiness of mind" (cf. Acts 17:11). When pushed by
either the liberal left or the independent right to depart from the Word as fully inspired,
trustworthy, and as the one authoritative guide for Christian belief and practice, let us make a
commitment that we will "not turn from it to the right or to the left." Instead, let us "meditate
on it day and night" and be careful to "do everything written in it" (Josh 1:7-8 NIV).
If we thus receive the Word, it will bring peace to our troubled consciences, comfort to our
broken hearts, light to our perplexed minds, and strength to our discouraged souls. Only then
can we truly sing that familiar song which in years past has brought hope and cheer to many a
weary pilgrim:
Give me the Bible, star of gladness gleaming,
To cheer the wanderer lone and tempest tossed,
No storm can hide that peaceful radiance beaming,
Since Jesus came to seek and save the lost.
Chorus:
Give me the Bible--holy message shining,
Thy light shall guide me in the narrow way.
Precept and promise, law and love combining,
'Till night shall vanish in eternal day.
Give me the Bible, when my heart is broken,
When sin and grief have filled my soul with fear;
Give me the precious words by Jesus spoken,
Hold up faith's lamp to show my Savior near.
Give me the Bible, all my steps enlighten,
Teach me the danger of these realms below;
That lamp of safety, o'er the gloom shall brighten,
That light alone the path of peace can show.20

Appendix A--The Authority of Scripture
The following document, one of the most insightful produced by the Seventh-day
Adventist church in recent times, was a discussion paper at the 1995 General Conference
Session. Although the session did not vote on it, we reproduce it here because it is a helpful
summary of the concerns addressed in this book.
Introduction
Scripture presents its message as revealed from divine sources. Although expressed in our
language by humans, it bears the authentic mark of God. Repeatedly we encounter the expression
"the word of the Lord came to me" or its equivalent. Jesus and the New Testament writers
accepted the Hebrew Scripture as having unquestioned authority.
We are familiar with Paul's reminder to Timothy, "All scripture is inspired by God and
profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man
of God may be complete, equipped for every good work" (2 Tim. 3:16, 17, RSV). And Peter
assures us that prophecy comes not from human sources, but "men moved by the Holy Spirit
spoke from God" (2 Peter 1:21, RSV).
Despite such biblical statements, we have arrived at a very different place in the history of
the faith.
Contemporary theology of almost any shade is now in crisis. It has become relativistic
and hesitating. There is no lack of religious literature, to be sure, but one scarcely hears a sure
word that recognizes divine authority. The foundations have been shaken. The major cause of this
ferment is as plain as the fact itself: an increasing number of our contemporaries deny the
existence of a solid platform on which Christian thinking can be built.
The breach between the Reformation and the Roman Catholic Church, 450 years ago, is
narrow when compared with the chasm separating those who affirm and those who deny the
existence of an objective divine revelation. In those days each side acknowledged the existence of
revealed truth. They differed only in its interpretation. Today there is widespread skepticism as to
whether an objective revelation exists at all.
General denial that divine revelation is objectively communicated in historical
occurrences and intelligible statements of truth has proved to be destructive for theology. In the
present climate, the Bible provides themes for theology, but no norms. Hence theology drifts
unchecked, subservient to the reigning philosophical or scientific consensus. Whenever the
content of Scripture is displeasing or regarded as irrelevant, it can be bypassed in favor of present
experience. The result is the death of true biblical theology. The Bible student is free to bend
revealed facts to his or her liking and to relativize the biblical truth, dissolving the biblical
message in the acid of human subjectivity.
What Is Normative?
Such trends have not left Seventh-day Adventists unaffected. Today, in place of the timehonored
view that Scripture is "the infallible revelation of His [God's] will," "the authoritative
revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history" (Fundamental Beliefs,
No. 1), some among us have come to claim that the truth of revelation is so wholly other, so far
beyond comprehension that no one can really say what it is or what it is not. Christian truths, we
are told, are relative rather than absolute and therefore neither universal nor normative.
256
Sources of Authority
Others no longer seem determined to limit themselves to Scripture in the formulation of
their views. Various sources--including Scripture, to be sure--are supposed to contribute
information from which theological statements are compiled. What happens in fact is that one
source comes to be treated as the preferred final authority. It may be reason, science, experience,
or some other factor, but it is not often Scripture.
Reason has a commendable function in theological expression. We do not wish to deny
its role as the discriminating faculty charged with detecting logical contradictions. But we dispute
its ability to inaugurate revealed truth, to function by itself as a source of revealed data. In a
sense, reason stands prior to revelation, since revelation must be perceived. But reason itself
cannot be that revelation.
Tradition too has a role to play in the exercise of biblical authority. To ignore Christian
history is to run the risk of repeating its mistakes. The Holy Spirit has been trying to teach
Christians for hundreds of years and Seventh-day Adventists for a century and a half. The Bible
is never interpreted in a vacuum, but read in the Christian community. That means that there are
traditional ways of interpreting it, even among Adventists, and we cannot ignore them. We must
listen to what Christians in the past have discovered, but at the same time we must be aware of
the danger of submitting the Bible to human interpretations. What we hear from tradition must
not stand on the same level with biblical revelation. Scripture is a critical authority confronting
the church; and the church and tradition, including our own, must be guided and corrected by the
canon of Scripture.
Science and Scripture
Equally pernicious are the claims of science to supersede biblical revelation. Today
biblical assertions of all kinds are in conflict with much of current scientific opinion. Hence
miracles are dismissed as violating immutable natural laws, and the existence of angels and
demons is held to be erroneous and superstitious.
The biblical doctrine of the seven-day creation is causing increasing controversy between
Adventist theologians and scientists. Some representing both groups have at times spoken rashly
or prematurely. The danger is that theologians will abandon the historicity and factuality of the
biblical account of Creation altogether in order to placate the scientists to whom the realm of
nature is thought exclusively to belong.
Can we Adventists truly acknowledge the authority of Scripture if we abandon our belief
in the reliability and historical authenticity of the Genesis account that teaches creation out of
nothing in seven days? Do we also discard the teachings found in chapters 2 and 3 of the same
book?
Enormous issues are involved in the doctrines of Creation and the Fall. Today's
neo-Darwinian theories are as much cultural myth as scientific statement--a working hypothesis,
not a proven theory. We should continue to be bold enough to say that the biblical statements
concerning the origin of the earth by a special creation of God as recorded in the book of Genesis
are a trustworthy and dependable account of what in fact did occur.
We recognize a significant interaction between science and Scripture. We need to avoid a
dogmatic dismissal of the whole scientific enterprise as perverse speculation. Science in its
fact-gathering capacity can serve Scripture well, illuminating the biblical text. But throughout our
history, science and the Bible have never been put on the same plane. The Bible is the Word of
God. Science is an empirical investigation of the natural world.
257
Cultural Conditioning and Authority
In the realm of history, objection is sometimes made to the reliability and authority of the
Bible on the grounds that there are considerable differences between the ways in which its writers
saw things and contemporary views. Cultural relativity, it is contended, makes it impossible for
us today to take the Bible seriously. Its pages have meaning only in terms of the cultures in which
they were written. Historical data and events were recorded, we are told, in the context of the
biblical writers and must therefore be tested today by the criteria of our contemporary culture and
historiography.
In general, this feeling represents Western cultural pride in the unspoken assumption that
it holds a superior standpoint. It is true that this approach does not necessarily demand that our
culture be superior, only that it be different. But are we o marooned on the island of our particular
culture that we cannot appreciate what those in other cultures are telling us? Are cultures
necessarily mutually incomprehensible? If we must not overlook the force of cultural relativism,
neither must we exaggerate it.
This is especially the case with the Bible. A continuous history, an unbroken connection,
binds us to those who wrote it. We have accepted it as part of our culture. This means strong
continuity exists as well as discontinuity. Furthermore, by speaking to universal human needs the
Bible in many ways supersedes all cultures: it speaks to humanity. The champions of cultural
relativism often are people of considerable independence of mind who cherish nonconformity, a
fact that may do credit to them as persons but damages the credibility of their arguments.
A Case for Investigation
Careful study remains essential, despite the fact that it is all too often put to destructive
purposes. The answer to negative study of the Bible is not to ban research but to engage in better
research. The God who chose to speak to us through writers living in specific historical, social,
cultural, and linguistic contexts has, by that very method of speaking, determined how His Word
is to be studied. Our understanding of the Bible cannot grow without sincere, thorough, and
devout study of, among other things, the biblical languages, and the background--historical,
cultural, political--of the biblical events. We must understand the circumstances in the life of
Israel, and later the church, which instigated comment from the prophets and apostles. We need
to appreciate the process by which the Holy Spirit produced the writings He caused God's people
to gather into the Bible. Biblical scholarship, when it works correctly and accepts Scripture in all
its parts--as it is and as God's Word--is not a method imposed upon the Bible from without. It is a
method demanded from within.
No one wishes to claim that all problems will be solved or that the answer to every
difficulty will be immediately apparent. Yet without wishing to minimize any of them we regard
no difficulty as insuperable. Upon careful scrutiny, what has happened so often in archaeology
may well occur again: so-called incontrovertible evidence of biblical errors may well be shown to
be no evidence at all.
Two Sources of Authority
There are only two ways to find out God's will and to state our doctrinal beliefs clearly:
(1) from special or supernatural revelation, which means the data first of all in Scripture and then
in the writings of Ellen G. White, and (2) from general revelation, such as nature and human
wisdom.

An unequivocal, even crucial emphasis on the inspiration and trustworthiness of Scripture
has made an invaluable contribution to the health and strength of the SDA Church. It has helped
us resist the error of treating some parts of Scripture as divine word while ignoring or rejecting
others. It has led us to treasure all parts of Scripture as "the infallible revelation of His [God's]
will" (Fundamental Beliefs, No. 1), and to seek to apply their teachings to all aspects of our life
and thought. To us "they are the standard of character, the test of experience, the authoritative
revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God's acts in history" (ibid.).
Is There a Place for Discipline in the Christian Life?
To submit to Scripture is part of our Christian calling. Freedom from Scripture is
darkness, not light. If the church allows its truth base to slip away, it will embark upon a search
for certainty and it will no longer be the pillar and bulwark of the truth, but essentially a debating
society for the discussion of ideas.
A solemn responsibility rests upon God's people to maintain the integrity and the spiritual
fervor of the church as it proclaims the everlasting gospel. Its character and life imply
commitments that are not optional but must be kept, values to be cherished, and conduct that is
normative. Thus questions arise: What demands shall the church make upon its members? What
is it to do if one refuses to comply with its demands, or if one's principles of conduct are no
longer in harmony with those it has developed? What is it o do if one's beliefs contradict those the
church considers itself to hold as of divine origin? Is one to be left to go his or her own way, and
to lead others also? Or is the church, local and universal, to confront such members, and if so, at
what point and in what measure?
The pervasive contemporary conviction is that every generation's theology is conditioned
by its social context and therefore destined to be discarded. It is therefore not surprising that some
among us contend that submission to confessional statements of faith defined by the church body
is a practice dangerous to the welfare and relevance of God's people. So we are told we should do
nothing in the face of doctrinal dissent. Even some leaders, sensing the current distaste for
religious contention and the deference to ecumenical cooperation, exhibit an increasing
impatience with controversy or disciplinary measures because of their apparent futility. Live and
let live!
For others, questions about censure and discipline are settled by the clear biblical mandate
of Matthew 18 and other statements in the New Testament epistles. For them, church discipline is
a command of Scripture, a matter of obedience. It is not the narrow exercise of a private set of
beliefs or a way of ridding the church of sinners, but rather redemptive and educative. Although
such discipline was widely practiced in the early church as well as throughout church history, in
today's climate of nonjudgmentalism it has appeared increasingly quaint and peculiar, and is often
abandoned, even among us.
On the other hand, discipline should not be impersonal or lack a redemptive focus. It must
never become a tool for expressing personal animosities.
But the integrity of the church is also at issue here. Church discipline is simply the right
of self-preservation. No argument about individual liberty, academic freedom, or popular
objection to "heresy trials" can negate the need for any group to preserve its fundamental
doctrinal commitments. Unless all beliefs are relative and doctrine purely a matter of personal
conviction, then action on the part of the church (i.e., discipline, both educative and remedial) is
one of the necessary means of preserving the integrity of truth in the church. The right of the
church--even its duty--to preserve the integrity of its doctrinal convictions is to be upheld. The
church has the right to a body of doctrine that is a test of fellowship as well as the right to censure
or exclude those who affirm some other creed. The clarity of the faith demands this. Any other
259
attitude has a debilitating effect on the mission and spiritual vitality of the church. Nor are we to
forget that discipline is part of discipling. To separate the two is not only to tear words from their
common root, but to split arbitrarily their organic relationship.
Today, faced with conflict against the unbelief of modernism and with the blindness of
those unwilling to listen to the advice of the believers, we need more than ever to understand the
nature and purpose of the end-time church. In so doing, we may clarify our personal
responsibilities and the unchanging realities of divine revelation. What is the church to be
according to God's Word? What are its character, identity, marks, and mission? A revival of our
awareness of the unique task that is ours will eventually sharpen questions related to the nature of
the church, as it always has throughout Christian history. Those who disparage biblical doctrine
must face a practical question: Does honesty permit one to continue in a church committed to the
exclusive support and proclamation of specific doctrinal truths? Without an uncompromised
regard for the authority of Scripture and our fundamental beliefs, only a shadow of Adventism
remains.
Recommendations
1. Conduct major conferences on biblical/Spirit of Prophecy authority and unity of belief
with the following objectives: (a) project a vision of the power and authority of Scripture for
salvation and victorious living, (b) make pastors and teachers aware of current trends in
problematic directions, (c) introduce the above concepts into faculty and pastors' meetings, (d)
encourage pastors and teachers to make presentations defending the Bible as authority, and (e)
gain support for standard Adventist positions.
2. Take steps to restore the process of church discipline in matters of doctrine as well as
practical life through sensitive and decisive action dealing with unfaithfulness in behavior and
beliefs, with the intention of educating and healing the church body.
3. Plan for conscious efforts to educate the church on how secular values infiltrate
Christian faith and practice.
4. Initiate a world study to identify ways that secular values are displacing biblical values
in Seventh-day Adventist faith and life.
5. Publish popularly written books and articles making available to the world church the
content of recent Biblical Research Institute documents.
6. Appoint boards who will employ and retain persons clearly in harmony with standard
Adventist positions.

Appendix B--The Use of Scripture
Like the document reproduced in Appendix A, this document was also a discussion paper at the
1995 General Conference Session. It sets forth some areas in which Scripture can be brought to
bear on the life and mission of the Seventh-day Adventist church.
The Use of Scripture in the Life of the SDA Church
Introduction
Scripture has always played a vital role in the life and thought of the Seventh-day
Adventist Church. From its beginnings the church has considered Scripture to be the source of
its faith and practice. It has been our guide in our quest to know God and understand His
eternal character. It has provided our ethical and moral values as well as our understanding of
ourselves and the world around us, and it has served as the determinant of the mission and
goal of the church and its institutions.
It is the Bible and the Bible alone that provides the prophetic mandate for our
existence as the remnant church and teaches us how to live as sons and daughters of God in
the midst of a fallen and corrupt world.
The implications of this fundamental theological posture are far-reaching. The
Scripture becomes not just the source of beliefs and practice but also the standard by which
the church, its message, its mission, and its institutions are to be evaluated. In fact, they
govern the whole life of the church in the sense that they provide the concepts, principles, and
values that should guide our personal lives as well.
The all-encompassing function of the Bible is clearly stated in 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
According to this pivotal passage, Scripture was given for doctrine, reproof, correction, and
instruction in righteousness. The ultimate objective is "that everyone who belongs to God
may be proficient, equipped for every good work" (NRSV).
Clearly the intent of God is that His Word be an intimate part of Christian experience.
David writes, "I have laid up thy word in my heart, that I might not sin against thee" (Ps.
119:11, RSV). The Word of God is the source of true wisdom (Ps. 119:98; Deut. 4:6), and
Paul writes to Timothy, "From childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings
which are able to instruct you for salvation" (2 Tim. 3:15, RSV).
Instead of standing as a cold framework of obligations, Scripture provides highly
personal guidance designed to benefit every believer. For this reason God directed that His
people diligently instruct their children in the Word of God (Deut. 6:7-9). Recovery of the
neglected Word of God leads to revival, as in Josiah's time.
One of the theological concepts that has contributed to the centrality of Scripture in
Adventist faith and life is the great controversy theme. In the cosmic conflict the goal of evil
forces is to distort and suppress the truth of God. God has revealed His truth in the person,
work, and teachings of Christ, which have been preserved for us by the Holy Spirit in
Scripture. It is, therefore, through this revelation that the church is able to distinguish between
truth and error.
Use of Scripture: Present Practice
261
The basic question is whether the theoretical understanding of the role of Scripture in
the life of the church is reflected in the daily life of the church. The immediate answer seems
to be Yes, it is. Nevertheless, there are new challenges and tendencies that if not addressed
may begin to shift the role of Scripture away from its vital and central place in the life of the
church.
Use of Scripture in the Administration of the Church
In the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church most administrators have been
known as deep, careful students of the Word. This was true of the pioneers, and also
characterizes many of our leaders today who take time in the midst of heavy schedules to
steep themselves in a clear understanding of the principles of Scripture. Nevertheless, because
of broad responsibilities assigned to leadership today, some church members feel that church
leaders often are more business-oriented than spiritually oriented, and that their knowledge of
Scripture is limited. The truthfulness of this perception has never been evaluated empirically.
A growing church places heavy burdens on its leaders and consumes most of their
time in administrative matters. One of the serious dangers that administrators face is not
finding time in their busy schedules to study the Scriptures. It may be useful to remember that
church leaders are also stewards of biblical truth. Hence, they should know the Scriptures
well.
Because Christ is the head of the church, it is unthinkable that any human instrument
should attempt to take over the direction of the body of Christ. It might help to think of the
church primarily as an organism rather than an organization. With that in mind, church
leaders are part of God's chain of communication. They need to understand God's will as
outlined clearly in Scripture, and do everything within their power to fulfill God's
expectations.
A dangerous tendency of the church is to consider that what God wants is determined
by a simple majority vote. Throughout our history the Holy Spirit has led individuals as well
as committees through prayerful study of Scripture. Does it not make sense today that the
church, its members, committees, and leaders should also seek to understand God's will for
their decision-making in the same way--by searching Scripture in order to apply its divine
principles to our contemporary concerns? Unity is the gift that God gives His people when
they find Him. Above all, we must be so tuned to Him and to the revelation of His will that
when we adopt an action or a program, the large body of believers will sense God's leading
and will rejoice to commit themselves fully to implementing it. Indeed, ours must be a vision
delineated by Scripture and fostered by the Spirit.
In this context it would be valid to remind ourselves that an increasing number of
laypersons are now members of most administrative boards and committees and are directly
involved in the decision-making process. Therefore, it would be equally inappropriate for
them to vote their personal convictions educated by personal preference or logic alone instead
of informed by a careful study of the Word of God and the real needs of the church.
Seventh-day Adventist church leaders, be they church employees or lay people, have
tremendous responsibilities not only to be deep students of the Word themselves, but to foster
a back-to-the-Bible movement that will help prepare our members for the great tests we will
face in the last great crisis.
Use of Scripture in Adventist Publishing Houses and Publications
262
Adventist publishing houses have provided the church with a plethora of
Bible-centered books that have nurtured the church and increased the knowledge of Scripture
among the church members.
Recently some Adventist books have fostered pluralism in some of the essential
doctrines of the church. Such publications have contributed to frustration among those
members who depend on our publishing houses to help guide them to a clear understanding of
the teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
Adventist leaders have come under fire because some of our publications are
perceived as either contradicting each other doctrinally or not taking a clear position on issues
that trouble the church. It is well known that our pioneers in their search for truth used our
periodicals to express, at times, conflicting views on different subjects. Therefore, difference
of opinion in nonessentials is not necessarily bad. Yet the question remains, Do our church
periodicals by their editorials and articles reflect the Bible-based stance of Adventism
throughout its history? The omission of clear references to the Bible in our periodicals could
send a subliminal message to the reader that plays down the importance of Scripture. Editors
should make sure that whatever is published is Bible-centered in content and unifying in its
effect.
It is a matter of concern that some Adventist Book Centers may be distributing books,
written by non-Adventists and by Adventists but not published by our publishing houses, that
contradict or reject some of our distinctive doctrines. This does not mean that we should
distribute only books published by our publishing houses; it does mean that care be taken in
the selection of those books published by non-Adventist publishers.
Members also feel that there is a lack of clearly written, easily understandable
materials that provide scriptural answers to the questions they face from so many sides today.
Use of Scripture in the Adventist Educational System
A generalized blanket statement on this topic cannot cover the educational program
throughout the world church. Our schools do encourage extended use of Scripture, although
some tend to do it more than others. Possibly there are some in the world church that do not
have adequate access to Bibles.
A number of anecdotal reports that come to church leaders express alarm over the
concern that some of our institutions of higher learning may be drifting away from the
standards and objectives established for them by their founders, resulting in what seems to be
a secular climate on some campuses, with strange winds of doctrine. There is also a concern
that methods of Bible study that undermine the authority of Scripture are, in some cases,
being used in religion classes. In some parts of the world this has resulted in the rejection of
the historicity of Genesis 1-11. Consequently, the Bible comes to play a minimal role in the
students' understanding of the origin of the world.
It has also been noted that some Bible classes seem to be taught only as an academic
exercise, omitting relevant application of Scripture for the daily life of the student. These
anecdotal perceptions should be discredited or confirmed by a serious study of these issues.
Use of Scripture in Denominational Medical Institutions/Offices
Seventh-day Adventist medical institutions today face extremely serious and
challenging ethical issues. It is very difficult to ascertain to what extent the Word of God is
playing a central and determinative role in their resolution. Elected leadership and the
constituency in general should make sure that Scripture is used in addressing those issues.
263
This implies keeping the constituency informed about the ethical problems and the way the
Scripture is being used in dealing with them.
Another area of concern could be the extent to which denominational standards
derived from Scripture are being followed in those institutions (e.g., Sabbath-keeping, diet). It
should be recognized that the issues are complex and difficult to deal with. Practicing our
distinctive beliefs in the hospital setting causes hospital administrators to face a myriad of
questions for which solutions are not always easily available. It is of utmost importance that
church leaders, with Scripture in hand, join hospital administrators in the search for the
answers they need.
However, it is quite clear that the Christian philosophy of healing sustained by
Adventists medical institutions is biblically based. The goal is to heal the whole person. That
goal is based in the biblical understanding of the person as an indivisible entity.
Use of Scripture in Pastoral Work and Preaching
Seventh-day Adventist church members frequently express their desire to hear more
biblical sermons based on the great themes and truths of Adventism, with some members
feeling that they are not being spiritually fed on Sabbath. Some of them suggest that the
messages they hear from week to week are those that could be preached in any Protestant
church. Unfortunately, there may be some basis to this perception. The possible connection
between this perception and the ministerial training of the pastors may need to be explored.
Use of Scripture Among Church Members
The use of Scripture among church members does not seem to be uniform throughout
the world church. In areas of the world in which members are actively involved in Bible
studies and preparing people for baptism, the Bible is being studied much more than in places
in which this involvement is absent. We do not describe ourselves as the "people of the Book"
as much as we have done in the past.
In a recent study of the use of Scripture among church members, some areas of the
world field indicated that more are using the Bible today for devotional purposes than they
did in 1980. This is indeed an encouraging sign. Nevertheless, there is a general perception
among workers that, in at least some areas of the world church, Bible literacy may have
declined among church members. This suggests that possibly they are less active in using the
Bible. Could it be that we are using the Bible more for devotion and inspiration than for deep
personal study?
Possibly the major concern here would be to know to what extent the principles,
values, and teachings of Scripture determine the thinking and behavior of church members.
Anecdotal information suggests that in general, church members do follow and are greatly
influenced by Scripture. In parts of the world some church members seem to have separated,
at least in some areas of their lives, their beliefs from their daily behavior.
Recommendations
1. Develop and implement plans to teach the world membership principles of biblical
interpretation.
2. Survey world membership to ascertain to what extent principles, values, and
teachings of Scripture determine the thinking and behavior of church members.
3. Develop seminars for church leaders to strengthen their use of Scripture in their
264
administrative decisions.
4. Develop plans to ascertain the influence and impact of Scripture in all aspects of
institutional life of SDA schools, colleges, universities, publishing houses, and medical
entities, and recommend to appropriate administrative bodies ways to strengthen the use of
Scripture in these institutions.
5. Evaluate pastoral education curriculum in SDA colleges and seminaries, and
recommend ways to place more emphasis on biblical preaching.
6. Take steps to assure basic doctrinal harmony among publications issuing from SDA
publishing houses.

Appendix C--Methods of Bible Study
At the 1986 Annual Council meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, church leaders representing all
the world fields approved the report of the General Conference's "Methods of Bible Study
Committee (GCC-A). This carefully worded document was published in the Adventist Review
(January 22, 1987), pages 18-20. Generally, all Bible-believing conservatives embrace this
report as reflective of the principles of interpretation that have been historically accepted by
Seventh-day Adventists. For a discussion of how Adventist scholars have related to this
document, see Chapter 4 of this book. The following is the entire text of the "Methods of Bible
Study" as was approved at Rio.
Voted, To approve the Methods of Bible Study Committee (GCC-A) report, which reads
as follows:
Bible Study: Presuppositions, Principles, and Methods
1. Preamble
This statement is addressed to all members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church with the
purpose of providing guidelines on how to study the Bible, both the trained biblical scholar and
others.
Seventh-day Adventists recognize and appreciate the contributions of those biblical
scholars throughout history who have developed useful and reliable methods of Bible study
consistent with the claims and teachings of Scripture. Adventists are committed to the acceptance
of biblical truth and are willing to follow it, using all methods of interpretation consistent with
what Scripture says of itself. These are outlined in the presuppositions detailed below.
In recent decades the most prominent method in biblical studies has been known as the
historical-critical method. Scholars who use this method, as classically formulated, operate on the
basis of presuppositions which, prior to studying the biblical text, reject the reliability of accounts
of miracles and other supernatural events narrated in the Bible. Even a modified use of this
method that retains the principle of criticism which subordinates the Bible to human reason is
unacceptable to Adventists.
The historical-critical method minimizes the need for faith in God and obedience to His
commandments. In addition, because such a method deemphasizes the divine element in the
Bible as an inspired book (including its resultant unity) and depreciates or misunderstands
apocalyptic prophecy and the eschatological portions of the Bible, we urge Adventist Bible
students to avoid relying on the use of the presuppositions and the resultant deductions associated
with the historical-critical method.
By contrast to the historical-critical method and presuppositions, we believe it to be
helpful to set forth the principles of Bible study that are consistent with the teachings of the
Scriptures themselves, that preserve their unity, and are based upon the premise that the Bible is
the word of God. Such an approach will lead us into a satisfying and rewarding experience with
God.
2. Presuppositions Arising From the Claims of Scripture
a. Origin
266
1) The Bible is the word of God and is the primary and authoritative means by which He
reveals Himself to human beings.
2) The Holy Spirit inspired the Bible writers with thoughts, ideas, and objective
information; in turn they expressed these in their own words. Therefore the Scriptures are an
indivisible union of human and divine elements, neither of which should be emphasized to the
neglect of the other (2 Peter 1:21; cf. The Great Controversy, pp. v, vi).
3) All Scripture is inspired by God and came through the work of the Holy Spirit.
However, it did not come in a continuous chain of unbroken revelations. As the Holy Spirit
communicated truth to the Bible writer, each wrote as he was moved by the Holy Spirit,
emphasizing the aspect of the truth which he was led to stress. For this reason the student of the
Bible will gain a rounded comprehension on any subject by recognizing that the Bible is its own
best interpreter and when studied as a whole it depicts a consistent, harmonious truth (2 Tim.
3:16; Heb. 1:1, 2; cf. Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 19, 20; The Great Controversy, pp. v, vi).
4) Although it was given to those who lived in an ancient Near Eastern/Mediterranean
context, the Bible transcends its cultural backgrounds to serve as God's word for all cultural,
racial, and situational contexts in all ages.
b. Authority
1) The 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the clear, infallible revelation of
God's will and His salvation. The Bible is the word of God, and it alone is the standard by which
all teaching and experience must be tested (2 Tim. 3:15-17; Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20;
John 17:17; 2 Thess. 3:14; Heb. 4:12).
2) Scripture is an authentic, reliable record of history and God's acts in history. It provides
the normative theological interpretation of those acts. The supernatural acts revealed in Scripture
are historically true. For example, chapters 1-11 of Genesis are a factual account of historical
events.
3) The Bible is not like other books. It is an indivisible blend of the divine and the human.
Its record of many details of secular history is integral to its overall purpose to convey salvation
history. While at times there may be parallel procedures employed by Bible students to determine
historical data, the usual techniques of historical research, based as they are on human
presuppositions and focused on the human element, are inadequate for interpreting the Scriptures,
which are a blend of the divine and the human. Only a method that fully recognizes the
indivisible nature of Scripture can avoid a distortion of its message.
4) Human reason is subject to the Bible, not equal to or above it. Presuppositions
regarding the Scriptures must be in harmony with the claims of the Scriptures and subject to
correction by them (1 Cor. 2:1-6). God intends that human reason be used to its fullest extent, but
within the context and under the authority of His Word rather than independent of it.
5) The revelation of God in all nature, when properly understood, is in harmony with the
Written Word, and it is to be interpreted in the light of Scripture.
3. Principles for Approaching the Interpretation of Scripture
a. The Spirit enables the believer to accept, understand, and apply the Bible to one's own
life as he[/she] seeks divine power to render obedience to all scriptural requirements and to
appropriate personally all Bible promises. Only those following the light already received can
hope to receive further illumination of the Spirit (John 16:13, 14; 1 Cor. 2:10-14).
b. Scripture cannot be correctly interpreted without the aid of the Holy Spirit, for it is the
Spirit who enables the believer to understand and apply Scripture. Therefore, any study of the
Word should commence with a request for the Spirit's guidance and illumination.
c. Those who come to the study of the Word must do so with faith, in the humble spirit of
267
a learner who seeks to hear what the Bible is saying. They must be willing to submit all
presuppositions, opinions and the conclusions of reason to the judgment and correction of the
Word itself. With this attitude the Bible student may come directly to the Word, and with careful
study may come to an understanding of the essentials of salvation apart from any human
explanations, however helpful. The biblical message becomes meaningful to such a person.
d. The investigation of Scripture must be characterized by a sincere desire to discover and
obey God's will and word rather than to seek support or evidence for preconceived ideas.
4. Methods of Bible Study
a. Select a Bible version for study that is faithful to the meaning contained in languages in
which the Bible originally was written, giving preference to translations done by a broad group of
scholars and published y a general publisher above translations sponsored by a particular
denomination or narrowly focused group.
Exercise care not to build major doctrinal points on one Bible translation or version.
Trained biblical scholars will use the Greek and Hebrew texts, enabling them to examine variant
readings of ancient Bible manuscripts, as well.
b. Choose a definite plan of study, avoiding haphazard and aimless approaches. Study
plans such as the following are suggested:
1) Book-by-book analysis of the message.
2) Verse-by-verse method.
3) Study that seeks a biblical solution to a specific life-problem, biblical satisfaction for a
specific need, or a biblical answer to a specific question.
4) Topical study (faith, love, Second Coming, and others).
5) Word study.
6) Biographical study.
c. Seek to grasp the simple, most obvious meaning of the biblical passage being studied.
d. Seek to discover the underlying major themes of Scripture as found in individual texts,
passages, and books. Two basic, related themes run throughout Scripture: (1) the person and
work of Jesus Christ; and (2) the great controversy perspective involving the authority of God's
Word, the Fall of man, the first and second advents of Christ, the exoneration of God and His
law, and the restoration of the divine plan for the universe. These themes are to be drawn from
the totality of Scripture and not imposed on it.
e. Recognize that the Bible is its own interpreter and that the meaning of words, texts, and
passages is best determined by diligently comparing scripture with scripture.
f. Study the context of the passage under consideration by relating it to the sentences and
paragraphs immediately preceding and following it. Try to relate the ideas of the passage to the
line of thought of the entire biblical book.
g. As far as possible ascertain the historical circumstances in which the passage was
written by the biblical writer under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
h. Determine the literary type the author is using. Some biblical material is composed of
parables, proverbs, allegories, psalms, and apocalyptic prophecies. Since many biblical writers
presented much of their material as poetry, it is helpful to use a version of the Bible that presents
this material in poetic style, for passages employing imagery are not to be interpreted in the same
manner as prose.
i. Recognize that a given biblical text may not conform in every detail to present-day
literary categories. Be cautious not to force these categories in interpreting the meaning of the
biblical text. It is a human tendency to find what one is looking for, even when the author [writer]
did not intend such.
268
j. Take note of grammar and sentence construction in order to discover the author's
[writer's] meaning. Study the key words of the passage by comparing their use in other parts of
the Bible by means of a concordance and with the help of biblical lexicons and dictionaries.
k. In connection with the study of the biblical text, explore the historical and cultural
factors. Archaeology, anthropology, and history may contribute to understanding the meaning of
the text.
l. Seventh-day Adventists believe that God inspired Ellen G. White. Therefore, her
expositions on any given biblical passage offer an inspired guide to the meaning of texts without
exhausting their meaning or preempting the task of exegesis (for example, see Evangelism, p.
256; The Great Controversy, pp. 193, 595; Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 665, 682, 707, 708; Counsels
to Writers and Editors, pp. 33-35).
m. After studying as outlined above, turn to various commentaries and secondary helps
such as scholarly works to see how others have dealt with the passage. Then carefully evaluate
the different viewpoints expressed from the standpoint of Scripture as a whole.
n. In interpreting prophecy keep in mind that:
1) The Bible claims God's power to predict the future (Isa. 46:10).
2) Prophecy has a moral purpose. It was not written merely to satisfy curiosity about the
future. Some of the purposes of prophecy are to strengthen faith (John 14:29) and to promote
holy living and readiness for the Advent (Matt. 24:44; Rev. 22:7, 10, 11).
3) The focus of much prophecy is on Christ (both His first and second advents), the
church, and the end-time.
4) The norms for interpreting prophecy are found within the Bible itself: The Bible notes
time prophecies and their historical fulfillments, the New Testament cites specific fulfillments of
Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, and the Old Testament itself presents individuals
and events as types of the Messiah.
5) In the New Testament application of Old Testament prophecies, some literal names
become spiritual: e.g., Israel represents the church; Babylon, apostate religion; etc.
6) There are two general types of prophetic writings: nonapocalyptic prophecy, as found
in Isaiah and Jeremiah, and apocalyptic prophecy, as found in Daniel and the Revelation. These
differing types have different characteristics:
a) Nonapocalyptic prophecy addresses God's people; apocalyptic prophecy is more universal
in scope.
b) Nonapocalyptic prophecy often is conditional in nature, setting forth to God's people
the alternatives of blessing for obedience and curses for disobedience; apocalyptic emphasizes
the sovereignty of God and His control over history.
c) Nonapocalyptic prophecy often leaps from the local crisis to the end-time day of the
Lord; apocalyptic prophecy presents the course of history from the time of the prophet to the end
of the world.
d) Time prophecies in nonapocalyptic prophecy generally are long, e.g., 400 years of
Israel's servitude (Gen. 15:13) and 70 years of Babylonian captivity (Jer. 25:12). Time prophecies
in apocalyptic prophecy generally are phrased in short terms, e.g., 10 days (Rev. 2:10) or 42
months (Rev. 13:5). Apocalyptic time periods stand symbolically for longer periods of actual
time.
7) Apocalyptic prophecy is highly symbolic and should be interpreted accordingly. In
interpreting symbols, the following methods may be used:
a) Look for interpretations (explicit or implicit) within the passage itself (e.g., Dan. 8:20,
21; Rev. 1:20).
b) Look for interpretations elsewhere in the book or in other writings by the same author
[writer].
269
c) Using a concordance, study the use of symbols in other parts of Scripture.
d) A study of ancient Near Eastern documents may throw light on the meaning of symbols,
although scriptural use may alter those meanings.
8) The literary structure of a book often is an aid to interpreting it. The parallel nature of
Daniel's prophecies is an example.
o. Parallel accounts in Scripture sometimes present differences in detail and emphasis (for
example, compare Matt. 21:33-44; Mark 12:1-11; and Luke 20:9-18, or 2 Kings 18-20 with 2
Chron. 32). When studying such passages, first examine them carefully to be sure that the
parallels actually are referring to the same historical event. For example, many of Jesus' parables
may have been given on different occasions to different audiences and with different wording.
In cases where there appear to be differences in parallel accounts, one should recognize
that the total message of the Bible is the synthesis of all its parts. Each book or writer
communicates that which the Spirit has led him to write. Each makes his own special
contribution to the richness, diversity, and variety of Scripture (The Great Controversy, pp. v, vi).
The reader must allow each Bible writer to emerge and be heard, while at the same time
recognizing the basic unity of the divine self-disclosure.
When parallel passages seem to indicate discrepancy or contradiction, look for the
underlying harmony. Keep in mind that dissimilarities may be due to minor errors of copyists
(Selected Messages, book 1, p. 16), or may be the result of differing emphases and choice of
materials of various authors [writers] who wrote under the inspiration and guidance of the Holy
Spirit for different audiences under different circumstances (ibid., pp.21, 22; The Great
Controversy, p. vi).
It may prove impossible to reconcile minor dissimilarities in detail which may be
irrelevant to the main and clear message of the passage. In some cases judgment may have to be
suspended until more information and better evidence are available to resolve a seeming
discrepancy.
p. The Scriptures were written for the practical purpose of revealing the will of God to the
human family. However, in order for one not to misconstrue certain kinds of statements, it is
important to recognize that they were addressed to peoples of Eastern cultures and expressed in
their thought patterns.
Expressions such as "The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh" (Ex. 9:12) or "an evil
spirit from God" (1 Sam. 16:15), the imprecatory psalms, and the "three days and three nights" of
Jonah as compared with Christ's death (Matt. 12:40) commonly are misunderstood because they
are interpreted today from a different viewpoint.
A background knowledge of Near Eastern culture is indispensable for understanding such
expressions. For example, Hebrew culture attributed responsibility to an individual for acts he did
not commit but that he allowed to happen. Therefore the inspired writers of the Scriptures
commonly credit God with doing actively that which in Western thought we would say He
permits or does not prevent from happening, e.g., the hardening of Pharaoh's heart.
Another aspect of Scripture that troubles the modern mind is the divine command to
Israel to engage in war and execute entire nations. Israel originally was organized as a theocracy,
a civil government through which God ruled directly. Such a theocratic state was unique. It no
longer exists and cannot be regarded as a direct model for Christian practice.
The Scriptures record experiences and statements of persons whom God accepted but
were not in harmony with the spiritual principles of the Bible as a whole--for example, incidents
relating to the use of alcohol, to polygamy, divorce, and slavery. Although condemnation of such
deeply ingrained social customs is not explicit, God did not necessarily endorse or approve all
that He permitted and bore with in the lives of the patriarchs and in Israel. Jesus made this clear
in His statement with regard to divorce (Matt. 19:4-6, 8).
270
The spirit of the Scriptures is one of restoration. God works patiently to elevate fallen
humanity from the depths of sin to the divine ideal. Consequently we must not accept as models
the actions of sinful men as recorded in the Bible.
The Scriptures represent the unfolding of God's revelation to man. Jesus' sermon on the
mount, for example, enlarges and expands on certain Old Testament concepts. Christ Himself is
the ultimate revelation of God's character to humanity (Heb. 1:1-3).
While there is an overarching unity in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and while all
Scripture is equally inspired, God chose to reveal Himself to and through human individuals and
to meet them where they were in terms of spiritual and intellectual endowments. God Himself
does not change, but He progressively unfolded His revelation to men as they were able to grasp
it (John 16:12; The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 945; Selected Messages, book 1, p. 21).
Every experience or statement of Scripture is a divinely inspired record, but not every statement
or experience is necessarily normative for Christian behavior today. Both the spirit and the letter
of Scripture must be understood (1 Cor. 10:6-13; The Desire of Ages, p. 150; Testimonies, vol. 4,
pp. 10-12).
q. As the final goal, make application of the text. Ask such questions as "What is the
message and purpose God intends to convey through Scripture? What meaning does this text
have for me? How does it apply to my situation and circumstances today? In doing so, recognize
that although many biblical passages had local significance, nonetheless they contain timeless
principles applicable to every age and culture.
5. Conclusion
In the Introduction to The Great Controversy, Ellen G. White wrote:
"The Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in the language of men, presents a union
of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of
God and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of Christ, that 'the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us.' John 1:14" (p. vi).
As it is impossible for those who do not accept Christ's divinity to understand the purpose
of His incarnation, it is also impossible for those who see the Bible merely as a human book to
understand its message, however careful and rigorous their methods.
Even Christian scholars who accept the divine-human nature of Scripture but whose
methodological approaches cause them to dwell largely on its human aspects risk emptying the
biblical message of its power by relegating it to the background while concentrating on the
medium. They forget that medium and message are inseparable and that the medium without the
message is as an empty shell that cannot address the vital spiritual needs of humankind.
A committed Christian will use only those methods that are able to do full justice to the
dual, inseparable nature of Scripture, enhance his[/her] ability to understand and apply its
message, and strengthen faith.
271
Glossary
Accommodationism/Accommodationists. Accommodationists (or theological moderates)
give the appearance of being Bible-believing conservatives, and yet they accommodate
conservative beliefs to liberal thought. Unlike radical/classical liberals, accommodationists
accept some or even all of the Bible's miracles and supernatural events, but they maintain that
the Bible is not fully reliable in everything. They employ modified versions of contemporary
higher criticism to interpret Scripture.
Allegorical Interpretation. A method of interpretation which assumes that a text conveys a
hidden, mystical meaning other than its literal, plain, ordinary sense. Its best-known
proponent is Origen of Alexandria (A.D. 185-254), who used Greek philosophical categories
to spiritualize away the plain meaning of Scripture in his attempt to discover these additional
meanings. Allegorical interpretation competed with Antiochian interpretation which tended to
be rational, historical, and literal.
Canon/Canonical. The word canon derives from a Greek word which means "rule." The
adjective canonical means something that has been accepted as the rule or norm. Applied to
the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments, the terms suggest that these inspired books are
the Christian's rule of faith and practice.
Canon within the Canon. An expression of higher criticism which implies that certain
portions of the biblical canon are more inspired than others. Those portions of Scripture
which the critical scholars arbitrarily credit as inspired and trustworthy, and therefore
meriting the label of God's Word, are known as the "canon within the canon."
Comparative-Religion Criticism. A higher-critical approach which claims that the Bible
writers borrowed from the polytheistic cultures around them. This liberal method seeks to
study the evolutionary development of the biblical faith from its assumed polytheistic or
primitive forms to its present monotheistic or matured form.
Conservatism/Conservatives. Theological conservatives seek to conserve or preserve the
view of Scripture set forth in the inspired Word itself and which formed the consensus of
Christendom from its very beginning until the rise of higher criticism. Bible-believing
conservatives accept the full inspiration and trustworthiness of the Bible in matters of
salvation as well as on any other subject the Bible touches upon. They reject the use of the
higher critical methodologies.
Cultural Conditioning. An expression describing higher critical scholars' assertion that at
least some parts of the Bible reflect the prejudices or limitations of the inspired writers'
culture and times. Since the Bible writers allegedly wrote from ignorance or a distorted view
of reality, such scholars argue that the "culturally conditioned" parts are not fully inspired and
binding.
Demythologization. A method of interpretation (associated with the name of Rudolf
Bultmann) which views much of the Bible as containing primitive forms of thinking and
which attempts to translate them ino modern categories.
272
Documentary Hypothesis. A higher-critical theory which maintains that Moses was not the
writer of the first five books of the Bible, but that these books can be traced to sources, or
documents, written later by various unknown authors and compilers. One hypothetical author
is called J (Yahwist, c. 850 B.C., during the early monarchy of Israel) because he supposedly
always called God "Jehovah." Another is known as E (Elohist, c. 750 B.C., shortly before
Israel's exile) because he allegedly used the Hebrew word Elohim for God. There is also D
(Deuteronomist, 621 B.C.), who is believed to have written Deuteronomy, and P (Priestly,
time of Ezra) who allegedly belonged to the priestly class after the exile. Based on this
hypothesis, higher-critical scholars chop up the Bible into pieces according to whether the
section uses the word Jehovah or Elohim, or if it contains references to priestly activity or
concerns. The theory was later applied to most Old Testament books and some New
Testament books.
Dynamic Equivalence. An approach to Bible translation that seeks to communicate the
original meaning in a given text by translating thought-for-thought. Because it seeks to make
the Bible clear and "alive" in today's language, it often loses many of the nuances of the
original language, thereby sacrificing accuracy. Often exhibiting the biases of translators, this
approach to Bible translation is most commonly reflected in Bible paraphrases.
Eisegesis (or Imposition). Reading into a text a meaning that is not there, by illegitimately
imposing onto it the interpreter's own opinion or ideology. Eisegesis is the opposite of
exegesis.
Exegesis (or Exposition). Reading out of a text a meaning that is already there, by faithfully
explaining the meaning of a text in its original context. Exegesis and hermeneutics are
sometimes used synonymously, even though the two terms are distinguishable: hermeneutics
deals with the underlying assumptions, principles, and methods of interpretation; exegesis is
the actual practice of interpretation, applying one's hermeneutical principles. Thus, the results
of exegesis depend upon the interpreter's (liberal or conservative) hermeneutical foundations.
A scholar who does the work of exegesis is called an exegete.
Form or Tradition Criticism. A higher-critical approach which seeks to get behind the
written sources of the Bible to the period of oral tradition and isolate the oral forms and
traditions alleged to have gone into the written sources.
Formal Equivalence. An approach to Bible translation that seeks to preserve all of the
information in the text, by translating word-for-word of the original language as much as
possible. Because it seeks accuracy in translation, sometimes the translation may be difficult
to understand or awkward to read.
Fundamentalism/Fundamentalist. A point of view characterized by belief in the literal truth
of the Bible. Because Bible-believing Christians accept the literal truthfulness of Scripture,
rejecting the approach of higher criticism, their liberal counterparts often label them
"fundamentalist" to suggest that conservatives are anti-intellectual, obscurantist, reactionary,
and authoritarian.
Hermeneutics. From the Greek word hermeneuein, meaning to explain, to express, to
translate, to interpret. As a science of interpretation, hermeneutics seeks to establish the
principles, methods, and rules needed for interpreting written texts, including the Bible. Every
273
hermeneutical method is based on a set of assumptions about the inspiration and
trustworthiness of Scripture.
Higher Criticism (Higher-Critical Method). An attitude of skepticism toward the Bible that
leads to rejecting those parts of Scripture judgedincompatible with the tenets of
Enlightenment rationalism. Practitioners of higher criticism refuse to receive the Scriptures as
God's inspired and trustworthy communication of His will to all humanity. In this approach,
human reason and experience, rather than inspired Scripture, are exalted as the objective,
dependable criteria to determine truth. Higher critics question, criticize, dissect, conjecture,
and reconstruct God's inspired Word, thus robbing it of its power. Today, higher criticism
operates under the various contemporary approaches of the historical-critical method.
Historical-Critical Method. An umbrella term that describes the contemporary manifestation
of old-fashioned higher criticism. As a liberal approach to Scripture, it does not accept the
Bible as fully inspired and trustworthy. Maintaining that some things recorded in the Bible
are not reliable or accurate accounts of what actually happened, critical scholars have put
forward several, often contradictory, approaches touted as "objective" paradigms of Bible
interpretation. These include: literary-source criticism, form or tradition criticism, redaction
criticism, comparative-religion criticism, historical criticism, structural criticism, etc. These
contemporary approaches are established on three major principles: analogy, correlation, and
criticism. The historical-critical method is the opposite of the historical-grammatical method
(the plain, literal interpretation of Scripture).
Historical Criticism. A historical-critical approach that adopts a skeptical attitude to the
historical claims of Scripture. It employs all the other techniques of the various approaches
bracketed under the historical-critical method and, in addition, draws upon archeology and
secular historical sources to determine authorship, date of writing, and what allegedly led to
the writing of the biblical book.
Historical-Grammatical Method. A term dating at least to 1788 to describe a method of
studying Scriptures which conducts a detailed analysis of the biblical text in accordance with
the original language and historical context. This approach, generally favored by
Bible-believing conservatives, recognizes the Bible as fully inspired and trustworthy. In
recent times, this expression has been employed as a technical term to describe the traditional
Adventist practice of interpreting Scripture according to its simple, literal, plain, direct, or
ordinary sense. The historical-grammatical method is the opposite of the historical-critical
method (contemporary higher criticism).
Illumination. A divine act which enables a person (prophet and non-prophet) in a right
relationship with God to understand God's revealed will correctly.
Infallible/Infallibility. Derives from the Latin infallibilitas, meaning the quality of neither
deceiving nor misleading. Applied to the Bible, the term suggests that Scripture is wholly
trustworthy and reliable. The word infallible is often used as a functional equivalent to
inerrant (from the Latin inerrantia, the quality of being free from factual, moral or spiritual
error). If we press the distinction, infallible would indicate "no potential for error" and
inerrant "no actuality of error." Infallible is the stronger word, although many people think
that the reverse is true. To declare Scripture as infallible or inerrant means to assert the Bible's
divine origin, truthfulness, and trustworthiness, never denying, disregarding, or arbitrarily
274
relativizing anything that the Bible writers teach.
Inspiration. A divine act by which God enables the prophet to grasp and communicate in a
trustworthy manner that which has been revealed to him/her in divine revelation.
Liberalism/Liberals (Classical or Radical). Theological liberals deny the full
trustworthiness of the Bible. Seeking to accommodate Bible truth to modern culture or
science, classical/radical liberalsdeny the validity of miracles and the supernatural, and they
adopt the methods of higher criticism (historical-critical method) as the way to restore the
truthfulness of the Bible. Compare Accommodationism.
Literal Interpretation. An attempt to understand the Bible in its plain, obvious, and normal
sense. This approach does not allegorize or spiritualize Scripture away in order to find some
hidden, mystical, deeper, or secret meaning. The literal or plain meaning of Scripture should
not be confused with a "literalistic" interpretation.
Literalistic Interpretation. An interpretation that fails to take into consideration the
historical, grammatical, and literary (e.g., poetry, parables, symbol, simile, hyperbole, epistle,
etc.) characteristics found in the Bible.
Literary-Source Criticism. A historical-critical approach that attempts to determine the
various literary sources presumed to lie behind the present record in the Bible.
Lower Textual Criticism. As distinguished from higher criticism of liberal scholarship,
lower textual criticism is a discipline that compares, analyzes, and evaluates ancient Bible
manuscripts to ascertain which reading of a passage is closest to the original.
Mechanical (Dictation) Inspiration. A mistaken theory which claims that the Holy Spirit
dictated each single word of Scripture. In this view of inspiration, the Bible writers are
perceived as passive "junior secretaries" who merely transcribed what the Holy Spirit dictated
to them. Mechanical (dictation) inspiration should not be confused with verbal
(propositional) inspiration.
Plain Reading of Scripture. Refers to the literal interpretation of Scripture by which an
interpreter seeks the plain, obvious, normal sense of Scripture. It is the method advocated by
the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformers, William Miller, and the Seventh-day Adventist
pioneers, including Ellen White. Contemporary scholars sometimes use the technical term
historical-grammatical method for this plain reading approach to Scripture.
Principle of Analogy. One of the three cardinal principles upon which the historical-critical
method is established. This principle holds that past events must be explained on the basis of
present occurrences (i.e., the present is the key to the past). This principle, for example,
suggests that since dead people are currently not rising from the grave, the past event of
Jesus' bodily resurrection recorded in the Gospels could not have been true.
Principle of Correlation. Another of the three foundational principles of the
historical-critical method. This principle states that every event must be explained solely by
natural causes, that is, by cause and effect in the natural world (i.e., every effect has a natural
cause). This means that there can be no miracles or supernatural occurrences; therefore,
275
wherever miracles occur in the Bible, we must either reject those sections or give the miracles
a naturalistic explanation.
Principle of Criticism. One of the three foundational principles of the historical critical
method. According to this principle, whenever you read any account in the Bible, instead of
accepting it as truth, treat it with a level of skepticism or at least accept it only tentatively,
with the possibility of revision (i.e., do not believe everything you hear or read in Scripture).
Skepticism is the key to establishing truth. Therefore as one approaches the Bible, one must
begin with suspicion rather than trust.
Progressive Revelation. A theological term indicating God's ever-increasing unfolding or
expansion of truth that was previously revealed. Each new revelation interprets and amplifies
the previous revelation but does not contradict it in any way. Historically, Seventh-day
dventists have referred to this as "present truth."
Proof-text. A verse or a longer passage that is used to establish a point. If the passage in its
context supports the point, such use is legitimate. However, the term is used in a pejorative
sense for a method that arbitrarily uses isolated texts out of context to support or prove
positions on which the interpreter has already made up his/her mind.
Redaction Criticism. A historical-critical approach which attempts to study the activity of
the "editors" of the Bible as they allegedly shaped, modified and even created the final
product.
Revelation. A divine act by which God discloses Himself, enabling the prophet to come to an
understanding (about someone, thing, or event) that the prophet could not have discovered or
fully understood on his/her own.
Spirit of Prophecy. Also known as the testimony of Jesus (Rev 19:10), it refers to the
messages of comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction that God commissions His true
prophets to deliver to His people (cf. Rev 1:1-2, 9; 22:8-10). It is also an identifying
characteristic of God's end-time remnant church (Rev 12:17). True prophetic messages never
contradict God's revelations given through earlier prophets and recorded most definitively in
inspired Scripture. Because Seventh-day Adventists believe that Ellen G. White was a true
recipient of this biblical gift of prophecy, they often refer to her writings as the "Spirit of
Prophecy" or the "Testimonies."
Structural Criticism. A historical-critical approach that attempts to investigate the
relationship between the surface structure of the writing and the deeper implicit structures that
belong to literature as such.
Theological Pluralism. Maintains that no theological or doctrinal truth can ever claim to be
absolute or final. Proponents argue that conflicting or contradicting theological views are
legitimate and must be allowed to cohabit in the church.
Typological Interpretation. A type of biblical interpretation in which persons, events, and
institutions in the Old Testament are understood as foreshadowing persons, events, or
institutions in the New Testament.
276
Vaticinium Ex Eventu. A technical term for the practice of describing what has already
happened as though it were a prophecy of something yet to happen. Based on the
higher-critical assumption that there can be no miraculous manifestations, including God's
ability to foretell the future, this term suggests that wherever there are clear evidences of
fulfilled prophecies, the prophecies must have been written after the event actually took place.
Verbal (Popositional) Inspiration. The Holy Spirit's guidance of inspired writers in
choosing their own words as they wrote Scripture. When inspiration is described as "verbal,"
it suggests that despite the inadequacies of human language, because of the Spirit's guidance,
the thoughts, ideas, and words of the Bible writers accurately convey God's message revealed
to them. Verbal inspiration should not be confused with mechanical (dictation) inspiration.

VHA Innovation Projects 
iForms (180), Med Rec (152), Checkout (153), IntelliNote (96)
Statement of Work (SOW)

1.0	Background:  The VHA Innovation Program is a cooperative effort between the Health and Medical Information Office (CHIO/HMIO) of VHA’s Office of Health Information (OHI) with VA’s Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) to catalyze and support VA’s next generation of Health Information Technology (HIT).  VHA Innovation Program Goals are to provide tools, resources and processes that:  encourage innovations to emerge from the field; allow innovations to evolve based on collaborative constructive review; provide a safe harbor for innovations to be piloted; and vet innovations from a business and technical perspective.   Four (4) specific innovations are described within this document.  

The four (4) innovation projects in this SOW are all to be based upon an existing Component Object Model (COM) framework for developing and delivering applications to users of the VA’s Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS).  CPRS has the capability of being extended by means of COM modules. These are custom programs that enhance and extend the functionality of CPRS.  The Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) has developed a versatile and robust framework based upon CPRS’s COM technology.  The LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object is a general-purpose CPRS extension that provides us with the ability to enhance CPRS now and in the future without the necessity of deploying additional CPRS COM object Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). to the workstations throughout the medical center.  We can extend the functionality of the COM object by writing server-side logic that processes client requests and returns content back to the COM object to be displayed to the CPRS user. 

2.0 	Scope/Mission:  The Contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, management, hardware, software, administrative support, travel, and technical services required to meet the performance objectives outlined in this SOW.  The scope is to provide for the development within the Innovation Program’s sandbox environment of four different prototypes for specific VHA Innovations programs that are based upon the common framework of the LLVAHCS COM Object.  The four projects will integrate with VistA and CPRS and retrieve and store data in these systems within the Innovation sandbox environment that will be provided to the Contractor.  All data retrieved from VistA/CPRS will be test data.  The prototypes developed by the Contractor will not interact with live or test systems installed at a VA facility.
The objective is to provide software engineering expertise in the development of the requirements and specifications, risk analysis, system architecture, implementation, testing, and ultimately installation of the final working products for each of the four (4) innovation projects described below.  The artifacts produced for each phase of the software development lifecycle must comply with VA architectural and coding standards as well as Section 508 accessibility standards of the Rehabilitation Act.

	2.1	Changes to the Statement of Work:  Any changes to this SOW shall be authorized and approved only through written correspondence from the Contracting Officer.  A copy of each change will be kept in a contract folder along with all other products of the contract.

6.0	Specific Tasks & Associated Deliverables: The Contractor shall perform the tasks and provide the specific deliverables described below within the performance period stated in this Statement of Work (SOW).

The four (4) innovation projects to be developed by the Contractor which are to be based upon the aforementioned COM technology are as follows:

1.	VistaForms (aka “iForms”) CPRS has the built-in capability for developing custom electronic forms.  However, this functionality is limited in several respects.  The tool used to create custom forms in CPRS is fairly basic, involving a text editor and a list of fields that can be manually added to create a form.  This precludes many users from creating more advanced forms due to the rather primitive tools available for form creation, and thus places the burden for the development of advanced forms on a relatively small number of users and programmers.   The resulting CPRS forms are also themselves limited in their ability to perform a number of functions.  For example, there are no means for implementing business logic, or even basic control flow logic, in the forms.  Many more complex clinical forms reflect a particular medical algorithm or protocol and require the ability to dynamically modify the form structure or fields depending upon the data being entered by the user or imported from VistA.  Additionally, many advanced forms that require formulas and calculations cannot be implemented using CPRS’s templates.  The Contractor shall develop a prototype framework for rapidly creating and delivering advanced electronic forms for clinical users within the CPRS developmental sandbox environment which would facilitate the continued improvement of electronic clinical documentation in the VA.  The application shall consist of a user-friendly development environment for visually designing the form interface and implementing scripting logic within the form and the server-side presentation and data processing tiers.  The application shall integrate with the aforementioned LLVAHCS CPRS COM Object framework within the Innovation Sandbox environment which provides the hosting platform for the delivery mechanism of the forms to the clinical user within the CPRS environment. The forms development environment is to be developed as a standalone application that allows a non-programmer to create forms by means of a drag-and-drop, rapid application development (RAD) interface.  To create a new form, the user selects a form template from a list of available layouts.  The user then adds text, graphics, or other design elements to the form and selects fields from a controls palette and inserts the fields onto the form.  Available controls include checkbox and radio button, textboxes, drop-down lists, and calendar and date fields.  The user can also insert the deidentified VistA test data objects into the form, including lookup lists and patient information retrieved from VistA. The user can also indicate which form fields are required and specify a range of data-entry values for form verification. A simple scripting language shall be developed which will allow the form designer application to implement basic control flow logic into the form.  The form delivery and processing engine component takes the form created using the development interface and produces a user-interface at run-time for the CPRS user.  The form itself is invoked via a note title in the Notes tab of CPRS and is displayed via a COM object dialog box.  When the form is completed and verified, the note text is generated and placed into the text box in CPRS, and the form data is saved into a VistA file or a SQL database table for further processing or analysis.

2.   Medication Reconciliation - Currently, the Loma Linda VA Healthcare System (LLVAHCS) uses a Component Object Model (COM object) interface to remind clinicians to perform and document medication reconciliation. Specifically, when a patient is admitted to the hospital, the COM object is initiated at patient selection, requesting completion of medication reconciliation before proceeding further into the patient’s record.  The COM object medication reconciliation tool imports the patient’s medications from VistA and presents them to the clinician on a form.  Checkboxes allow the clinician to select which medications will be continued during hospitalization and which will be discontinued. Additional over-the-counter medications or outside prescriptions can be added through the COM object interface. When the form is completed, a progress note is automatically generated which can be signed through the COM object or edited and signed in CPRS.  In addition, the COM object saves medication reconciliation information to a database to allow for monitoring compliance with the medication reconciliation tool by clinical staff.  The Contractor shall develop an improvement to the COM tool in the Innovation Sandbox environment which allows for a medication ordering function.  The LVAHCS COM object would provide a form with a list of pre-admission medications. Since most VA patients receive their medications from the VA pharmacy, this list will be pre-populated with simulated active, expired, on-hold and pending medications from the VistA pharmacy package. In addition, this list will include in a separate section for non-VA, simulated over-the-counter and herbal medications that will be pre-populated with any medications that have been entered in this VistA/CPRS package. Additional entries for non-VA, over-the-counter, and herbal medications can be entered on the form which will populate that file in VistA/CPRS.  This pre-admission list will be saved in a file in VistA. Once the pre-admission list is populated, the clinician will then review each medication and in a separate column then take action on each medication. The prototype should allow for medications that will be continued during the inpatient stay to be checked or perhaps moved to another column.  When the inpatient list is completed, inpatient orders are ready to be completed. The prototype should integrate to the feature in CPRS which enables the user to transfer outpatient medication orders to inpatient orders, thus allowing the clinician to select a complete button which will generate the inpatient medication orders. These orders will be generated for review and signature and will invoke the usual alerts for medication interactions, redundant drug classes, etc.  Once the orders are completed, the COM object will generate a progress note documenting the pre-admission medication list as well as the inpatient orders generated during medication reconciliation. At discharge, the discharge pharmacist or clinician can invoke the discharge medication reconciliation COM object that will generate the pre-admission medication list as well as the current inpatient medication list. The clinician or pharmacist will take action on each medication and generate a list of discharge medications.  The COM object-based application will create a discharge medication note as well as a patient-friendly list of discharge medications for the patient.  

3.  Automated Clinic Checkout Sheet - The Contractor shall develop an application to provide patients with a patient-friendly summary of their outpatient visit or inpatient stay in an efficient and mostly automated manner.   Using the LLVAHCS COM technology in the Innovation sandbox environment, medication, lab, consult, imaging and text orders in VistA/CPRS would be translated into a readable, patient-friendly instruction sheet.  At the conclusion of an outpatient visit, clinic staff will invoke the COM object through a CPRS note template, a note title, or from the CPRS tools menu.  For example, staff will enter the checkout sheet note title in the progress notes tab of CPRS and the COM object checkout sheet would launch.  Using a medical terminology translation engine, orders placed by the clinician during the visit are translated into patient-friendly language and displayed back to the user in the COM object. Clinic staff print the checkout sheet and give it to the patient to take with them.  A progress note is also created with documentation of the contents of the checkout sheet.   Items included on the checkout instructions include: 1) the provider’s name, clinic name and contact information; 2) future appointments; 3) lab tests; 4) imaging and other tests; 5) consults; 6) all active medications as well as discontinued medications (reconciling changes); 7) medication indications (when only one indication for a medication exists) and; 8) other patient instructions including self-care and patient education.   Patient education and self-care instructions are initiated from a CPRS order menu.  This menu will contain a standard list of instructions for various problems including diet, exercise, wound care, antibiotic instructions, etc.  In addition, the menu will contain lists of patient education sheets from Krames On Demand.  The provider selects a patient education topic and this appears in the checkout sheet as a patient education sheet with an embedded hyperlink to the Krames On Demand intranet site.  Staff doing patient checkout click on the education topic in the COM object checkout sheet and print the Krames On Demand handout. For inpatients, the solution would work much the same way.  First and foremost, the COM object discharge instructions will include discharge medications reconciled using the COM object medication reconciliation described above.  In addition, providers would use discharge menus to select discharge orders for diet, ambulation, wound care and other self-care instructions and education.  Providers will also select patient education material from Krames On Demand from order menus.  Therefore the discharge instructions display discharge medications, self-care instructions, patient education, future appointments, orders for imaging tests and other procedures, consults, lab tests and contact information for the patient’s primary care physician.

4.  IntelliNote Diabetes Care Tool - The importance of the treatment for diabetes to the VA health care system is unquestioned but major deficits in care (exist?) are obvious. The VA embarked on an ambitious project to remodel diabetes assessment and intervention through the development of the IntelliNote. The VA has assembled a consortium of clinicians, bioinformaticians, and IT experts to address IntelliNote development. To begin to develop a solution to improving diabetes care, the VA surveyed CPRS records of diabetics with noted care deficits and specifically categorizes these deficits. Any IT developed application will need to address these administrative, patient and clinician focused problems. Based on its initial evaluation the VA is structuring an IT application, IntelliNote, using the LLVAHCS Component Object Model (COM) technology.  The Contractor shall develop within the Innovation program’s sandbox environment a prototype IntelliNote - an innovative and unique solution to diabetes care deficits.  This application will be designed to accomplish the following: 1. The clinician will activate IntelliNote by creating a new note in CPRS with a specific title. The relevant coded and structured data will be automatically displayed to the clinician in a format that will be both tabulated and trended for evaluation. VA diabetes clinics have developed a note format using a simple mnemonic based on 6 areas of care and formats them into an A, B, C headings. For example A being the A1C etc. Using our current “A, B, C” diabetic note structure all of the 6 major diabetes care areas or fields will be assessed and presented to the clinician.  As in every clinical note, the clinician may add unstructured free text.  To minimize “check box fatigue” there will be no requirement for adding free text. The second and most unique aspect is to provide guideline specific recommendation based on decision support rules of logic for each diabetes care field. The recommendations will be generated by the latest clinical guidelines, the VA guidelines and current formulary restrictions and validated by a decision support committee.  The decision support recommendation format will make recommendations based on current gathered information. For example, a diabetic with a low-density lipid (LDL) cholesterol not at goal will have a recommendation to start or adjust the VA approved medication after surveying the adverse drug fields and laboratory fields for contraindications.   3. Based on the clinicians’ action, IntelliNote will provide an order set that will allow medication starts and adjustments, laboratory ordering and appointment follow up.  Automatic ordering of exams that will fulfill performance measures will be included. A clinical action committee will decide on the order sets and when established will not require multiple actions by the clinician. For example, a veteran with the elevated LDL cholesterol will automatically be given a laboratory order for two (2) months to reevaluate any medication changes. 4. IntelliNote will generate a patient “report card” in the current “A, B, C” format that can be used by the veteran to track their progress in diabetes care. In addition the report card can provide upcoming orders and appointments within each diabetes care field.   5. IntelliNote will generate a note within CPRS to document the  patient encounter in a structured format allowing for unstructured text entry. The text entry field will be designed to allow innovative text analytic analysis and reformatting text into a structured format for ongoing and future administrative and clinical assessments.

 SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES
 
 C.1  52.204-7  CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)
 
   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
 
   "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.
 
   "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.
 
   "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4- character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
 
   "Registered in the CCR database" means that--
 
     (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and
 
     (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.
 
   (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the Offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
 
     (2) The Offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the Offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Offeror is registered in the CCR database.
 
   (c) If the Offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
 
     (1) An Offeror may obtain a DUNS number--
 
       (i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
 
       (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The Offeror should indicate that it is an Offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
 
     (2) The Offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:
 
       (i) Company legal business.
 
       (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.
 
       (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.
 
       (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).
 
       (v) Company Telephone Number.
 
       (vi) Date the company was started.
 
       (vii) Number of employees at your location.
 
       (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.
 
       (ix) Line of business (industry).
 
       (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).
 
   (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.
 
   (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.
 
   (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
   (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
   (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.
 
                            (End of Clause)

         (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
 
         (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-- Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
 
         (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

The prior, express written permission of the Contracting Officer is required to assert copyright in all other data first produced in the performance of this contract.
 
       (ii) When authorized to assert copyright to the data, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notices of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402, and an acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number).
 
       (iii) For data other than computer software, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid- up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly by or on behalf of the Government. For computer software, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid- up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in such copyrighted computer software to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly (but not to distribute copies to the public) by or on behalf of the Government.
 
     (2) Data not first produced in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall not, without the prior written permission of the Contracting Officer, incorporate in data delivered under this contract any data not first produced in the performance of this contract unless the Contractor--
 
       (i) Identifies the data; and
 
       (ii) Grants to the Government, or acquires on its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or, if such data are restricted computer software, the Government shall acquire a copyright license as set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this clause (if included in this contract) or as otherwise provided in a collateral agreement incorporated in or made part of this contract.
 
     (3) Removal of copyright notices. The Government will not remove any authorized copyright notices placed on data pursuant to this paragraph (c), and will include such notices on all reproductions of the data.
 
   (d) Release, publication, and use of data. The Contractor shall have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, except--
 
     (1) As prohibited by Federal law or regulation (e.g., export control or national security laws or regulations);
 
     (2) As expressly set forth in this contract; or
 
     (3) If the Contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of this contract that contain restrictive markings, the Contractor shall treat the data in accordance with such markings unless specifically authorized otherwise in writing by the Contracting Officer.
 
   (e) Unauthorized marking of data.
 
     (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract concerning inspection or acceptance, if any data delivered under this contract are marked with the notices specified in paragraph (g)(3) or (g) (4) if included in this clause, and use of the notices is not authorized by this clause, or if the data bears any other restrictive or limiting markings not authorized by this contract, the Contracting Officer may at any time either return the data to the Contractor, or cancel or ignore the markings. However, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253d, the following procedures shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings.
 
       (i) The Contracting Officer will make written inquiry to the Contractor affording the Contractor 60 days from receipt of the inquiry to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings;
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 60-day period (or a longer time approved in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions.
 
       (iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.
 
     (2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder.
 
     (3) Except to the extent the Government's action occurs as the result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Contractor is not precluded by paragraph (e) of the clause from bringing a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, that may arise as the result of the Government removing or ignoring authorized markings on data delivered under this contract.
 
   (f) Omitted or incorrect markings.
 
     (1) Data delivered to the Government without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The Government is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.
 
     (2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer in writing for good cause shown) after delivery of the data, permission to have authorized notices placed on the data at the Contractor's expense. The Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Contractor--
 
       (i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;
 
       (ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;
 
       (iii) Establishes that the proposed notice is authorized; and
 
       (iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.
 
     (3) If data has been marked with an incorrect notice, the Contracting Officer may--
 
       (i) Permit correction of the notice at the Contractor's expense if the Contractor identifies the data and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or
 
       (ii) Correct any incorrect notices.
 
   (g) Protection of limited rights data and restricted computer software.
 
     (1) The Contractor may withhold from delivery qualifying limited rights data or restricted computer software that are not data identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause. As a condition to this withholding, the Contractor shall--
 
       (i) Identify the data being withheld; and
 
       (ii) Furnish form, fit, and function data instead.
 
     (2) Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer database for delivery to the Government shall be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software.
 
     (3) [Reserved]
 
   (h) Subcontracting. The Contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government under this contract. If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government those rights, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the refusal and shall not proceed with the subcontract award without authorization in writing from the Contracting Officer.
 
   (i) Relationship to patents or other rights. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government.

 C.12  VAAR 852.209-70 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JAN 2008)
 
   (a) It is in the best interest of the Government to avoid situations which might create an organizational conflict of interest or where the Offeror's performance of work under the contract may provide the contractor with an unfair competitive advantage. The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.
 
   (b) The Offeror shall provide a statement with its offer which describes, in a concise manner, all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) or actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the services to be provided under this solicitation. The Offeror shall also provide statements with its offer containing the same information for any consultants and subcontractors identified in its proposal and which will provide services under the solicitation. The Offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its organizational and/or management system or other actions would avoid or mitigate any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest.
 
   (c) Based on this information and any other information solicited or obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR 809.503.
 
   (d) Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the contract at no expense to the Government.

 C.14  52.204-11  AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT--REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009)
 
   (a) Definitions.  As used in this clause-
 
   "Contract", as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16.
 
   "First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act.
 
   "Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.
 
   "Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).  This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.
 
   "Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)):
 
     (1) Salary and bonus.
 
     (2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights.  Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments.
 
     (3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans.  Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees.
 
     (4) Change in pension value.  This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans.
 
     (5)  Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified.
 
     (6)  Other compensation.  For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000.
 
   (b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public.
 
   (c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009.  Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter.
 
   (d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at http://www.FederalReporting.gov.
 
     (1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable.

     (6) An assessment of the contractor's progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act.
 
     (7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide-
 
       (i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor's existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and
 
       (ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained.
 
     (8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if-
 
       (i) In the Contractor's preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received-

     (9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount.
 
     (10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report.

       Line Item No.           Country of Origin
 
       ______________          _________________
 
       ______________          _________________
 
       ______________          _________________
 
 [List as necessary]
 
       (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
 
   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the Offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

For statistical purposes only, the Offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the Offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The Offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
 
       (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the Offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
 
       (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
        (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the Offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the Offeror if the Offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the Offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
 
     (1) All Offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the Offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the Offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
 
       [  ] TIN has been applied for.
 
       [  ] TIN is not required because:

 E.4  BASIS FOR AWARD
 
 
Any award will be made based on the best overall (i.e, best value) proposal that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the four evaluation factors: Technical, Past Performance, Price and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business. The Technical Factor is significantly more important than the Past Performance Factor. The Past Performance Factor is significantly more important than the Price Factor.  The Price Factor is significantly more important than the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Factor.  The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. To receive consideration for award a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for the Technical factor.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price Offeror.
 
 E.5  EVALUATION CRITERIA
 
 
The following evaluation criteria shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Technical, Past Performance, Price and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business Participation.
 
 E.6  EVALUATION APPROACH
 
 
1. TECHNICAL:  

The evaluation of an Offeror’s technical approach will consider the following:

(1) Understanding of the Problem - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear understanding of all features involved in meeting the requirements presented in the Statement of Work (SOW) and the extent to which uncertainties are identified and resolutions proposed.

(2) Feasibility of Approach – The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposed approach is workable and the end results achievable. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the level of confidence provided the Government with respect to the Offeror’s methods and approach in successfully meeting the requirements in a timely manner. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the Offeror is expected to be able to successfully complete the proposed tasks and technical requirements within the required schedule. The evaluation will also consider the realism of the allocated hours, labor categories and materials.  

(3) Completeness – The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror’s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each requirement of the solicitation has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the solicitation.


2.  PAST PERFORMANCE:

The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with the Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance.  The Offeror shall submit a list of recent and relevant contracts for evaluating Past Performance.  Relevant past performance information may include key personnel who have relevant experience, predecessor companies, and subcontractors who will perform major or critical elements of this solicitation.  Areas of relevance include contracts that are similar in scope to the SOW.  Recency includes contracts and task orders awarded within three (3) years of the date of the solicitation. Past performance evaluations will be conducted using information obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and any other source deemed appropriate. Offerors without relevant past performance, or for whom past performance information is not available, will receive a neutral rating (FAR 15.306 (a) (2) (iv)).

Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the Offerors, it is incumbent upon the Offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk is with the Offeror.

3.  PRICE:

The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated based on the Total Evaluated Price.  The total evaluated price will be the sum of all line items or CLINS/SLINS.
4.  SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS AND VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION: 

In accordance with VAAR 852.215-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors, the Government will assign evaluation credit for an Offeror (prime contractor) which is a service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) or a veteran-owned small business (VOSB) Offerors which agree to use 7% or more of the contract value to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business or Veteran-Owned Small Business will also receive evaluation credit. In accordance with VAAR 852.219-72, Evaluation Factor for Participation in the VA Mentor-Protégé Program, the Government will assign credit to businesses with approved Mentor-Protégé Agreements.
